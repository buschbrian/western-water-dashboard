"""Refresh reservoirs.json for the Utah Reservoir Drought Dashboard.

Pulls daily storage (af) from Reclamation RISE and daily/monthly storage
from USDA NRCS AWDB for the wider Utah reservoir inventory, then computes a
set of drought metrics per reservoir:

- pct_of_record_max: current storage vs. the highest storage seen in the
  pulled date range (proxy for % of physical capacity, not the real thing).
- seasonal_percentile: where today's storage ranks against *prior years'*
  values within a 7-day day-of-year window. Prior years only, so "lowest
  this week has ever been" can actually read as 0.
- seasonal_normal_af / pct_of_seasonal_normal: today's storage against the
  median storage for this same week in prior years -- the "is this normal
  for August?" read that pct_of_record_max can't give you.
- 7/30/365-day changes, this year's peak, and a 12-month monthly history
  (with a per-calendar-month normal from prior years) for the trend chart
  and table in the dashboard popups.

Every reservoir also carries explicit freshness fields (as_of, days_stale,
is_stale, fetch_ok). Reclamation's feed can go quiet for an individual
reservoir for days at a time while every other one keeps updating, and the
old version of this script published those frozen values indistinguishably
from fresh ones. Now staleness is data, and the dashboards render it.

No local CSV cache -- this always re-pulls the full date range fresh, since
it runs in an ephemeral GitHub Actions environment. RISE's own disclaimer:
data is provisional and recent values are subject to revision.

WHERE THINGS LIVE. This file is the orchestrator: read it for the sequence,
not for the arithmetic. Each specialised concern is a module in `pipeline/`
and every public name in them is re-exported here, so `import
refresh_reservoirs as R` still reaches all of it:

    pipeline.constants   paths, thresholds, schema and method versions
    pipeline.roster      the committed admissions and capacity evidence
    pipeline.providers   one adapter per provider, and their retry policy
    pipeline.seasonal    the estimator: window, annual votes, normals, rank
    pipeline.numbers     rounding and ratios, decided once
    pipeline.history     a series read at a date, and the last twelve months
    pipeline.freshness   carry-forward, withdrawal threshold, the notice
    pipeline.geography   county and drainage-area assignment

What stays here is what the orchestrator does with them: `summarize` (one
record from one series), the reference-export sections, the CI signals, and
`main`. See docs/architecture/pipeline.md and pipeline/AGENTS.md.

    thing and then walked it coordinate by coordinate on the main thread to
    type-check it. The maps take their outlines from the hosted Watershed
    Boundary Dataset now, quantized to whatever the reader is looking at, so
    what this file still owes them is the roster: which areas are in scope,
    what each is called, which states it touches, and a box to open a map on
    (`bbox`, `huc.outer_bbox`) -- four numbers rather than the ring itself,
    coarsened outward so it still contains what it is a box of. Publishing
    that is what lets `src/viz/extent.ts` build an opening view for any set
    of units a reader chooses (state, region, subregion) without shipping
    the polygons a view like that would otherwise need in the browser.

    The committed GeoJSON does not go away. `source_file` still names it, the
    pipeline still assigns every reservoir with it, and it stays reviewable in
    the repository -- it simply stops being published, exactly as normals.json
    already is. That is what keeps the outlines from disagreeing with the
    assignments: the codes published here are read out of that same file.

    All of them, not just the drawn one: the scopes exist to be compared
    (docs/UPPER-COLORADO-PIPELINE.md), and a research scope that ships only
    as a file on disk cannot be compared against anything. `default_scope`
    is what keeps that from changing the dashboard -- the extra scopes are
    available, and one of them is the accepted geography.

    Two of them are named. `default_scope` is what the maps draw, 75 basins
    since 2026-08-18; `roster_scope` is the geography the reservoir roster was
    admitted from, still the fourteen areas that touch Utah, and it is what
    the storage map opens on (ADR-063). They were the same name for as long
    as coverage and roster moved together.

    A *published* scope that is missing, short, duplicated or out of region
    raises rather than exporting quietly. This is reference data assembled
    from committed files, not a network fetch that might come back thin;
    there is no partial answer here that is better than a loud failure.

    A registered scope that is not published is skipped, and that is not the
    same thing as tolerating a missing file. A geography gets registered,
    fetched, measured and reviewed before anything draws it -- the western
    scopes are in that state now -- and until it is marked for publication
    there is nothing for this export to be missing.
