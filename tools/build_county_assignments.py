"""Build counties.json: the county each reservoir sits in.

Counties are a *search* axis, not an aggregation one. That was measured before
this was written: 68 reservoirs fall in 34 counties and 19 of those hold
exactly one, so a chart of county storage is a chart of individual reservoirs
wearing a county's name. What counties are good for is the question people
actually ask -- "how is Washington County doing" -- which is a filter.

The assignment is committed rather than computed each morning, for the reason
capacities.json is: an assignment that can change underneath you is not
reproducible, and a reservoir that silently moves county between two runs is
the kind of error nobody would catch by looking.

**Built from the committed roster, never from reservoirs.json.** A reservoir
whose feed goes quiet for two months is withdrawn from the payload entirely
(ADR-056) -- Elkhead Reservoir is withdrawn today -- and it has not moved
county by going quiet. Reading the payload would drop it here, and it would
come back months later with no county and nothing to say so. This is the rule
CLAUDE.md already states for tests about where a reservoir is, reaching the
tool that decides it.

**The point is the waterbody, not the dam** (ADR-058). The drainage assignment
deliberately uses the dam -- a drainage area is where the stored water leaves
-- and a county deliberately does not. Two reservoirs differ, and Lake Powell
is the one that settles it: Glen Canyon Dam is in Coconino County, Arizona,
and the lake a Utah reader is asking about is in San Juan County, Utah.

Geometry is queried, never committed. The service resolves the point against
its own full-resolution polygons and answers with a code; there is nothing to
store and nothing to keep in step. That is ADR-048's rule -- the roster, not
the polygons -- reaching a second geography.
