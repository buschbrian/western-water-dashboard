"""Build the upstream index: what drains to each published reservoir.

For every published reservoir, ask the USGS Network-Linked Data Index (NLDI)
for the contributing basin above its point, then test which of this project's
own published points -- reservoirs and snow sites -- sit inside it. The
output is a committed reference file keyed by station id (ADR-066), holding
for each reservoir the upstream reservoir stations, the upstream snow
stations, and the NLDI COMID the trace was taken from.

    python tools/build_upstream_index.py            # build or rebuild
    python tools/build_upstream_index.py --only "Flaming Gorge"
    python tools/build_upstream_index.py --json     # machine-readable report

It writes nothing else, and it never publishes geometry: the basin polygon is
the tool's input and stops there (ADR-048). The scoping behind this --
endpoint shapes measured live, cost, why precompute rather than fetch at
runtime, and what a trace cannot say -- is
docs/UPSTREAM-TRACE-SCOPING.md.

Three decisions the tool encodes, each its own screen:

**The dam sits inside its own basin.** A reservoir's own point lands inside
its contributing area by construction, so every trace begins by excluding
itself. That is a deliberate one-line rule rather than an accident of
geometry, and the file says so.

**A trace is evidence, and evidence can fail.** A station whose point
answers no flowline (`no_flowline`), or whose COMID answers no basin
(`no_basin`), is recorded as screened out with the reason -- never as an
empty upstream set, which would read as "nothing drains here" when the truth
is "we could not trace".

**Size is screened too.** Lake Powell's contributing area is most of the
Upper Colorado, about 108,000 square miles, and that is a correct answer. A
basin several times that size means the trace matched the wrong kind of
river -- a trunk stream draining far beyond the western scope -- and the
trace is flagged for review rather than trusted.

The area is approximate on purpose: a spherical excess summed around the
ring, good enough to separate 100,000 square miles from 500,000, labelled in
the file as what it is.
