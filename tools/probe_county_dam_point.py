"""Probe: which reservoirs would move county if counties followed the dam.

The drainage assignment is made at the dam, because a drainage area is where
the stored water leaves. The county assignment is deliberately made at the
published waterbody point (ADR-058): Glen Canyon Dam is in Coconino County,
Arizona, and the lake a Utah reader asks about is in San Juan County, Utah.
`OPEN-BACKLOG-SCOPING.md` left open how many reservoirs would move if
counties followed the drainage rule instead. This probe measures it.

It reads the merged reviewed dam points from `pipeline.roster.load_capacities`
-- `capacities.json` plus every admitted provider roster, the same points the
refresh and upstream trace use -- assigns each against the same full-resolution
Census-counties service `build_county_assignments.py` used for the committed
file (so the diff measures the two points, not two sources), and diffs the
answer against `counties.json`.

A probe prints and writes nothing. The committed assignments do not change
here whatever the diff says; reopening ADR-058 is a decision, not a side
effect of a measurement.

    python tools/probe_county_dam_point.py

Only stations with a reviewed dam point can be asked; that subset is reported
as what it is.
