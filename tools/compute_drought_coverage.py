"""Compute weekly drought coverage for each published drainage area.

Reads the committed U.S. Drought Monitor polygons, the committed boundaries
of the drawn scope and the committed land mask, and writes the percent of
each drainage area's *measured* land in each intensity class. The downloaded
polygons are *exclusive*: each feature covers exactly its class, verified by
probing interior points, so "D1 or worse" is a sum of disjoint areas rather
than a union.

The monitor maps the United States and stops at both borders, so a drainage
area crossing one is only partly measurable. Cells outside the mask are
dropped before any class is counted, rather than falling into "none" and
being read as land with no drought on it -- which is what they used to do.
Measured against the western basins, that put 75.2 phantom drought-free
points in Kootenai and 51.8 in Upper Columbia (ADR-059). A partly measured
area publishes a separate `measured` block saying how much of it the figures
above cover; a wholly measured one publishes none, so every drainage area
published today is byte-for-byte what it was before the mask existed.

    python tools/compute_drought_coverage.py
    python tools/compute_drought_coverage.py --step 0.02 --output out.json

Method: even-odd scanline sampling. Each drainage area's bounding box is
covered by a grid of cell centres ``step`` degrees apart. A grid row is one
latitude; every polygon segment crossing that latitude is solved for its
longitude once, and a point is inside when an odd number of crossings sit to
its west -- the same even-odd rule as the repository's ray-casting point
tests, so holes and multiple parts need no special cases. Each point is
weighted by the cosine of its latitude, because a degree of longitude narrows
toward the pole and an unweighted count would overstate the north of every
unit. That weight is not an approximation of an equal-area projection: it is
the exact area element of a sphere, so this already measures equal area and
the only open question was ever which figure of the earth it assumes. The
result is deterministic for a given pair of input files: no timestamps, so an
unchanged week writes an unchanged file.

Two error terms, both measured against the committed inputs (ADR-055), in the
percentage points this file publishes, against a rounding boundary of 0.05:

    area model, sphere against the WGS84 ellipsoid       0.004
    sampling, the 0.002-degree step against convergence  ~0.001
    control: dropping the latitude weight entirely       0.286

So the sampling dominates, the area model cannot move a published figure, and
an equal-area projection -- which is what Albers would supply -- would change
nothing a reader could see. The first thing to reach for if the published
precision ever tightens past 0.1 is a finer step, not a projection.

WHAT THE ERROR BUDGET DOES NOT COVER: THE INPUT GEOMETRY ON THE OTHER SIDE.
Both measured terms compare one computation of this engine against another
over *the same simplified polygons*. The Drought Monitor classes and the land
mask are both fetched at roughly 100 m resolution, and the grid step is about
185 m of latitude -- the same order -- so a finer step than 0.002 samples a
geometry whose own tolerance is coarser than the sampling. Because
`tools/measure_drought_convergence.py` varies only the step while holding the
polygons fixed, it cannot see this term at all; no measurement here bounds it.
The practical consequence is narrow but worth stating: **a step finer than
0.002 degrees buys nothing until the geometry tolerance is measured too**, so
do not spend seventy more seconds a morning chasing it. ADR-037 already moved
the drainage boundaries to about 56 m so they sit below the grid; the monitor's
classes and the mask are the inputs this note is about.

WHY THE STEP IS 0.002 AND NOT 0.01. It was 0.01, whose sampling error was
measured at 0.069 -- above the 0.05 that moves a published tenth. That figure
was a single worst case; measured over every share this engine publishes,
`tools/measure_drought_convergence.py` counts how many would round to a
different tenth than a fine reference gives. On the map of 2026-08-11, over 844
shares in 75 areas, against a 0.001-degree reference:

    0.01     59 of 844 (7.0%) would print a different tenth,  10s
    0.005    17 of 844 (2.0%),                                21s
    0.002     5 of 844 (0.6%),                                80s

0.6% is the engine's floor rather than a residue to chase: those shares sit on
a rounding boundary, where no step settles the digit. Seventy seconds a morning
buys a published tenth that means what it says, in a job that runs once a day
and is otherwise waiting on other people's web services. Run the tool again
before moving the step; it writes nothing.

`tests/test_area_model.py` holds both terms against a geodesic oracle;
`tests/test_drought_coverage.py` holds the engine to known shapes and the
committed output to its own arithmetic.
