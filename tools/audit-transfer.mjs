/*
 * What a reader actually downloads to open each page, and from where.
 *
 * The SDK budget in `scripts/check-sdk-bundle.mjs` measures the bundler's
 * graph: what the entry *could* pull in. This measures the other thing, which
 * is the one a reader experiences -- what the browser really requested before
 * the page was usable, how many bytes came over the wire, and which hosts were
 * involved. The two disagree in both directions and both are worth knowing:
 * the graph counts chunks a reader may never fetch, and the wire counts
 * basemap tiles and font atlases that appear in no bundle at all.
 *
 * It answers three questions the modernization plan asks:
 *
 *   - are the lazily-loaded chunks actually lazy, or is something importing
 *     them on the way in;
 *   - what does each page weigh on first load;
 *   - which hosts does the application contact, which is the measurement a
 *     Content-Security-Policy has to be written from rather than guessed at.
 *
 * On demand, like `profile-symbols.mjs`. It needs a built `dist/` and a real
 * Chromium, and it reports rather than asserts -- the assertions that protect
 * the project live in the build budget and the browser suite.
 *
 *   npm run build
 *   node tools/audit-transfer.mjs
 *   node tools/audit-transfer.mjs --json    # for diffing between runs
 *   node tools/audit-transfer.mjs --headed  # real canvas, so imagery counts
