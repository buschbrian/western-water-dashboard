"""Add each dam's coordinates to capacities.json.

Watershed assignment is supposed to use the point where the stored water
*leaves* a reservoir -- the dam or outlet -- because a large reservoir can
span a drainage divide and only one of those answers is meaningful. The
published `lat`/`lon` on each record is not that point: it is a lake point
copied from a RISE catalog record or an AWDB station, a median of 1.08 km
from the dam and, for Lake Powell, 20.87 km away.

`capacities.json` already records the NID id of the dam each capacity came
from, so the coordinates can be fetched **by id** -- no name matching, and
therefore none of the risk that made build_capacity_table.py careful about
attaching the wrong dam.

Committed rather than fetched at refresh time, for the same reason as the
capacities themselves and the watershed boundaries: an assignment that can
change underneath you is not reproducible.

    python tools/add_dam_points.py --dry-run   # report, write nothing
    python tools/add_dam_points.py             # update capacities.json

Superseded, and kept only for repair. `tools/build_capacity_table.py` writes
`dam_lon` and `dam_lat` itself now: it fetches the geometry to match on
position, so the coordinates are already in hand and a second pass over the
same rows can only disagree with the first. Running this after that tool
rewrites the same fields from a second query, which is the arrangement that
lets two files describe one dam differently.
