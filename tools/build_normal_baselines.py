"""Build normals.json -- a 1991-2020 climate normal for every reservoir.

## Why this is a separate tool rather than part of the daily refresh

The daily pipeline requests from 2015 because that is all it needs to say
what a reservoir is doing now. That start date then became, by accident, the
answer to a much bigger question: every "normal for this week" on the site is
a median over 2015 onward, which is the driest eleven-year stretch in the
modern record of this region. Measuring today against it flatters today. The
snowpack half of the site meanwhile compares against the standard 1991-2020
climate normal, so the two halves of one dashboard were answering "is this
normal?" against different definitions of normal.

The providers were probed before this tool was written, because a baseline
nobody has the data for is not worth building:

    record starts 1991 or earlier : 54 reservoirs   98.2% of combined capacity
    starts 1992 to 2010           :  8 reservoirs    1.5%
    starts after 2010             :  5 reservoirs    0.3%
    no reading returned           :  2 reservoirs    0.0%

So the climate normal is real for essentially all of the water. Lake Powell
reaches 1963, Bear Lake 1911, Utah Lake 1932. Jordanelle starts in 1993 --
that is the dam's own age, not a hole in the record, and the output says so
rather than hiding it.

## Why it is committed rather than fetched each morning

A climate normal over a closed period cannot change. Refetching thirty years
of daily readings for sixty-nine reservoirs every morning would multiply the
refresh's request volume for an answer that is identical every time, and it
would put the whole daily publish at the mercy of a thirty-year query. This
follows the precedent capacities.json already set: a fact that is a property
of the period rather than of today belongs in the repository.

The *recent* baseline stays computed live in refresh_reservoirs.py, because
that one genuinely does move as the record grows.

## What is in it

Per reservoir, per day of the year, the median storage within the same
+/- 7-day window the daily pipeline uses -- deliberately the same window
function, imported rather than reimplemented, so the two baselines differ
only in which years they draw on and can be honestly put side by side.

Each day also carries how many distinct calendar years contributed to it. A
median over three years and a median over thirty are not the same claim, and
the site has to be able to say which one it is showing.
