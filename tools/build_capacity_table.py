"""Build capacities.json from the National Inventory of Dams.

RISE publishes no capacity (tools/probe_rise.py has the proof), so
`pct_of_record_max` divides by the highest storage ever *observed*, which
drifts as the record grows. NID is the authoritative alternative: USACE
maintains it, it is in acre-feet, and it covers every Utah dam.

Three storage figures are recorded per reservoir so the choice of
denominator can change later without re-fetching:

  normal_storage  storage at the normal (conservation) pool -- what
                  operators usually mean by "capacity", and what this
                  dashboard divides by
  max_storage     storage at the maximum pool, including flood surcharge
  nid_storage     NID's own headline figure (generally max of the two)

Every match is sanity-checked against the storage we have actually
observed since 2015: a capacity below the observed record max means the
row is almost certainly the wrong dam, and is reported as a failure rather
than written out. Name matching across two agencies is exactly the kind of
thing that silently attaches Deer Creek's numbers to some other Deer Creek.
