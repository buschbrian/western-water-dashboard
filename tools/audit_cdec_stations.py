"""Which California Data Exchange Center reservoirs could be published.

The same question `audit_awdb_stations.py` and `audit_candidate_capacity.py`
answer for the two federal providers, asked of California's own service:
which of its storage stations sit in a drainage area this site draws, are not
already tracked, and can be given a full level.

    python tools/audit_cdec_stations.py
    python tools/audit_cdec_stations.py --json > cdec-candidates.json

It writes nothing to the published data. The admission rules live in
`admission.py` and are unit tested; this tool fetches and prints what they
decided, so a person reviews the evidence before anything is committed.

Three things about this service that the two federal ones did not require:

  - **`-9999` is the missing-data sentinel, and it is a number.** Measured on
    2026-08-20 over a week across all 238 storage stations, 537 of 1,435
    values were `-9999` and none were null. At 37% this is the dominant shape
    of the data rather than an edge case, and a reader of the value field who
    treats it as a number subtracts ten thousand acre-feet from a total. Every
    read here goes through `usable`, and nothing else may touch `value`.

  - **The roster is HTML; only the data is JSON.** There is no station-list
    endpoint that answers in a machine format, so the table is parsed out of
    the search page. The parse is strict and fails loudly rather than
    returning a short list, because a silently short roster reads exactly like
    a service that has retired some stations.

  - **Being listed is not reporting.** 82 of the 238 stations carrying the
    storage sensor returned nothing usable over that week. They are excluded
    here rather than admitted and then carried forward as stale, which is a
    different thing from ADR-056's carry-forward: that is for a feed that has
    gone quiet, not for one that never spoke.

**A reviewed exclusion is applied to the series here as well** (ADR-116), out
of the same committed file and through the same matcher the refresh uses, so
the verdict this tool prints is the verdict the published pipeline would reach.
Every excluded reading is printed and carried into `--json`: the point of an
exclusion is that a reviewer can still see what was left out.

The observed maximum used by the admission screen is read at monthly
resolution. Thirty times fewer rows than daily, and the screen only asks how
much water has ever been seen -- a monthly maximum answers that.

#: roster carries 28 million acre-feet twice -- the exact double count ADR-011
#: and ADR-062 exist to prevent. Upper Klamath is the quieter version of the
#: same thing at 2.1 km, just outside this radius.
#:

#: Reservoir three times -- whole, federal share and state share -- and the
#: whole one is the one with a published capacity, so a rule that trusted the
#: service's own figure would admit the double count in preference to the
#: parts.
