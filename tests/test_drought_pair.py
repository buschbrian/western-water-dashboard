"""The guard that keeps the two drought files on the same week.

The drought view refuses to draw when the polygons and the coverage figures
name different weeks. That refusal protects the reader; this tool protects the
commit, by catching the mismatch in the refresh workflow while both files can
still be put back. These tests hold it to that job.

They stay data-independent, like the coverage tests beside them: nothing here
asserts this week's drought, so a Thursday release cannot turn the suite red.
