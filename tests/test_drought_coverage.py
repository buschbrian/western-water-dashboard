"""The drought coverage engine against shapes with known answers, and the
committed weekly output against its own arithmetic.

The synthetic fixtures use squares near the equator so the cosine weighting
is almost uniform and the expected percentages are exact up to sampling
resolution. The committed-file tests stay data-independent: they assert
structure and self-consistency, never this week's drought, so a Thursday
release cannot turn the suite red.
