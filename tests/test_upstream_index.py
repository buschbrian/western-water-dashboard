What is tested here is what a trace may claim: rings flattened so one ray
cast can answer, self-exclusion as a stated rule rather than a geometric
accident, screens that distinguish "nothing drains here" from "we could not
trace", and an area approximation honest enough to separate a correct
continental basin from a wrong one.
