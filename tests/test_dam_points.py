"""Which structure of a dam project supplies the assignment point (ADR-057).

Network-free. A dam identifier names a project, and three of the committed
ones return several rows -- a dam and its dikes -- carrying the same storage
and different coordinates. The point is the drainage-area assignment point, so
"whichever row arrived last" is not an answer that survives two runs.
