"""The owner table for committed data files, held to the repository.

`data/generated-files.json` says who writes each committed data file and which
of them the daily refresh commits. Prose said the same thing in four places and
none of them was checked, which is how `data/drought/usdm-huc4.json` came to be
recomputed every morning by the workflow and staged by none of them: the
committed file sat a week behind the polygons beside it, and the only thing
that noticed was a test about drought, not about ownership.

These tests are deliberately about *classification*, not about content. A new
committed data file has to be classified before it can be merged, which is the
cheapest possible moment to decide whether a person or a program owns it.
