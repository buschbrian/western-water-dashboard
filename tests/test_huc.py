"""Tests for the committed watershed boundaries and the point assignment.

Network-free, like the rest of the suite: the boundary files and
`reservoirs.json` are all committed, so this asserts against exactly what
ships rather than against whatever the USGS service returns today.

Two files are in play since the coverage moved west (ADR-063). The drawn
scope's file is what `load_units` reads and what every reservoir is assigned
against -- 75 basins. `ROSTER_BOUNDARIES` is the fourteen the roster was
admitted from, which is a subset of it and is what the map opens on.

What this guards is the thing that would otherwise fail silently. A wrong
watershed assignment does not throw, does not blank the map and does not
change a single storage number -- it just files a reservoir under the wrong
basin, and the only way to notice is to know the geography. These assertions
encode that knowledge.

Run with `pytest tests/` or directly with `python tests/test_huc.py`.
