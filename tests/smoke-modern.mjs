 *
 *   - Every reservoir in the connected scope actually drew. A shell that

 *     screenshot; the readiness signal counts them.
 *   - The page never asks for ArcGIS credentials. The SDK's sign-in prompt
 *     is a custom element that mounts itself into a shadow root, so an
 *     `innerText` check over the light DOM cannot see it. This walks open
 *     shadow roots, and it runs with the first basemap answering 401 --
 *     the exact condition that produces a prompt when the anonymous-auth
 *     policy is missing.
 *   - Nothing scrolls sideways and the interactive map controls stay in a
 *     clear touch lane at 1280, 390 and 360 pixels.

 * layer that does not answer is simply not added, because a page drawing its
 * own committed data must not go blank when another organisation's service
 * is down.
 *
 * That design is what made this suite untrustworthy. On a machine that
 * cannot reach those services the SDK logs one console error per layer, and
 * every listener below counted each of them as a failure -- so the run
 * failed differently every time and said nothing about the application.
 * Measured on 2026-08-31: thirteen failures on a working branch and four on
 * the same commit's parent, every one of them this.
 *
 * They are now counted apart rather than filtered away, which is the
 * difference that matters. Filtering would hide the day the fallback itself
 * breaks. Counting apart lets the run say "these layers were unreachable"
 * out loud, and lets each page assert the thing that was never asserted
