 *
 *   - Every reservoir in the connected scope actually drew. A shell that

 *     screenshot; the readiness signal counts them.
 *   - The page never asks for ArcGIS credentials. The SDK's sign-in prompt
 *     is a custom element that mounts itself into a shadow root, so an
 *     `innerText` check over the light DOM cannot see it. This walks open
 *     shadow roots, and it runs with the first basemap answering 401 --
 *     the exact condition that produces a prompt when the anonymous-auth
 *     policy is missing.
 *   - Nothing scrolls sideways and the interactive map controls stay in a
 *     clear touch lane at 1280, 390 and 360 pixels.
