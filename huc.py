"""Watershed membership for each reservoir.

Three facts get attached to every published record: which six-digit hydrologic
unit its water drains through, whether its provider point is in Utah, and
whether its waterbody intersects Utah. They are separate on purpose. A
drainage area does not stop at a state line -- Lake
Powell's water comes down the Green from Wyoming and the Colorado from
Colorado -- so "reservoirs in Utah" and "reservoirs in drainage areas that
touch Utah" are two different questions and the dashboard has to be able to
ask each one without the other quietly changing.

Standard library only, and deliberately kept out of refresh_reservoirs.py:
this is geometry with no series, no network and no pandas in it, so it can be
tested on its own and reused by tools/probe_huc_points.py without dragging
the whole data stack along.

Boundaries come from the file the drawn scope names, written by
tools/fetch_watershed_scope.py from the USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset and
committed. Committed rather than fetched at refresh time for the same reason
as capacities.json: an assignment that can change underneath you is not
reproducible, and a reservoir that silently moves basin between two runs is
the kind of error nobody would catch by looking.

Which file that is comes from `watershed_scopes.DEFAULT_SCOPE` rather than
being written here. It was `huc6.geojson` for as long as there was only one
answer; publishing the west made it a second copy of a product decision, and
the failure mode of a second copy is that the pipeline assigns reservoirs
with one geography while every surface draws another.

# The value is *every* state the waterbody touches, including the one holding
# the provider point, so an entry describes the waterbody rather than a
# correction to somewhere else. Bear Lake's point is in Idaho and Meeks
# Cabin's in Wyoming; both reach into Utah, which is why they are here.
#
# Absence means "the waterbody is in the state its point is in", which is true
# of every reservoir nobody has had reason to review. That is a default, not a
# finding, and `waterbody_states` says so by returning the point's state alone.
# Lake Powell carries different evidence, and it is this project's own: its
# reviewed dam point is in Coconino County, Arizona and its published
# waterbody point in San Juan County, Utah (ADR-057, ADR-058), so the water
# between them crosses the line and no external lookup is needed to say so.
# Measured across every reservoir holding both points, it is the only one --
# which is why the Utah-only table never needed it: that table existed to add
# Utah to waterbodies whose *point* was elsewhere, and Powell's point is
# already in Utah. Generalising the question exposed the gap.
