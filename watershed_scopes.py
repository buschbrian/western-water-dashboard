"""Named watershed extraction scopes used by the data tools.

The dashboard draws ``west-huc6``: every HUC-6 basin draining to the Pacific
or closed inside the west, which is 75 of them. It drew the fourteen that
touch Utah until 2026-08-18, and that scope is still registered and still
exported -- it is the geography the reservoir roster was admitted from, which
is a different question from which areas are drawn and is named separately in
``ROSTER_SCOPE``.

A scope carries the hydrologic level it is expressed at. The drawn scope is
HUC-6 and every figure on the site is keyed there, but the level is a property
of the scope rather than an assumption of the code -- so a HUC-4 or HUC-8
scope is a new entry in this table rather than an edit to every caller.

Levels above 8 are deliberately absent, and that is a measurement rather than
an omission: the drought coverage engine samples on a fixed grid, and the
share it computes for one unit is only as good as the number of cells inside
it. A HUC-6 gets about 33,000 cells and lands within 0.03 points of geodesic
truth; a HUC-8 about 4,800 and roughly 0.08; a HUC-10 about 640 and roughly
0.21, which is twice the precision the site publishes. `compute_drought_coverage`
refuses outright below one grid cell. Finer levels need an exact-geometry area
engine first.

# may pan over comes from the areas that hold reservoirs, not from every area
# drawn -- otherwise a still-unadmitted pool would still have opened the
# storage map on 19 degrees of longitude with every reservoir in one corner of
# it. `src/viz/extent.ts` holds the box, this names the file it is the box of,
# and `reference.json` publishes the name so the two cannot drift.
#

# original roster was admitted from -- kept registered and published, because
# 16 of the 137 R1 candidates still land inside it and a reader with an old
# link to one of those areas must keep resolving. `tests/test_watershed_
