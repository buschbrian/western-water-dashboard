/**
 * How each reservoir compares with its own normal for the date, against how
 * large that normal is.
 *
 * The question this answers is the one percent-full cannot: a reservoir at
 * 60% in April and one at 60% in September are not the same news.
 *
 * WHY THE HORIZONTAL AXIS IS LOGARITHMIC. The tracked reservoirs run from
 * Lake Mead at 28 million acre-feet to Lost Lake at a few hundred -- more than
 * five orders of magnitude. Spread linearly, the two largest set the range
 * and every other reservoir collapsed into one smudge against
 * the origin, so a chart whose whole purpose is per-reservoir comparison
 * could be read for no reservoir except the biggest. A logarithmic axis
 * spends the same width on each tenfold step, which is the only arrangement
 * that holds a 400 acre-foot reservoir and an 11,000,000 acre-foot one and
 * says something about both.
 *
 * WHY THE VERTICAL AXIS IS A RATIO AND NOT ACRE-FEET. Making both axes
 * logarithmic fixed the crowding and destroyed the meaning: the SDK's fitted
 * line is computed in linear space and drawn as a straight segment between
 * its endpoints, so on logarithmic axes it left the cloud entirely and hung
 * along the right-hand edge -- and "dots below the line" is the whole claim
 * of the chart. Percent of normal answers that claim directly and needs no
 * fit: 100 is the level, it is the same 100 for every reservoir whatever its
 * size, and it can be drawn as an actual line across the plot.
 *
 * The point colours come from the storage class table (ADR-008) through the
 * layer renderer, so a dot's colour here means what the same colour means on
 * the map.
 */
/**
 * The sentence naming every reservoir the ratio axis could not reach.
 *
 * The bound above decides what the chart draws; this decides what the card
 * says, and the two are deliberately separate. A reader who cannot see a dot
 * is owed the dot's name and its value, not a note that some data is missing
 * -- Seven Oaks Dam at 932% of usual is the most interesting reservoir on the
 * page.
 *
 * The names and the numbers, and no explanation of them. The obvious sentence
 * to add is that these reservoirs hold very little on this date, so a small
 * change in storage moves the ratio a long way -- and it is true of Seven
 * Oaks, whose usual level is 0.2% of its full pool, and false of Casitas,
 * whose usual level is 40% of its own. One sentence cannot carry a cause that
 * differs per reservoir, and a plausible one that is wrong for half the list
 * is worse than none.
 *
 * Empty string when every reservoir fits, so the caller renders nothing
 * rather than a sentence saying nothing happened.
