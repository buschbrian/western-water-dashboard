/*
 * One reservoir as a page of its own.
 *
 * The rules live here so they are testable; the entry point is wiring. Two
 * questions the module answers, both settled before this page was built
 * (docs/OPEN-BACKLOG-SCOPING.md, decision 4):
 *
 * **Which reservoir does a link name?** The same three-way rule the storage
 * map applies (`findReservoir`): the station identifier first, because it is
 * the identity and cannot be ambiguous (ADR-066); then the qualified label
 * the reader can see on screen -- "Lost Creek, OR"; then a bare name, which
 * resolves only when exactly one reservoir holds it. A bare name shared by
 * two resolves to neither: picking one would answer a question the link did
 * not ask.
 *
 * **What does a withdrawn reservoir's page say?** A page for a withdrawn
 * reservoir must still load -- that is the argument for one static shell over
 * sixty-eight generated ones. The payload's withdrawal notices carry no
 * measurement (ADR-056), so the page can say the reading was withdrawn and
 * when it was last real, and nothing more. Matching is by bare name against
 * the notice, which is all a notice carries.
