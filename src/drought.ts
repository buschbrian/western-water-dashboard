The two shares divide by different things, one by land and one by reservoir capacity, so the site never states their difference as a number. The rows are ordered by that distance.

The unit is points of the area's own land, and both figures are the same measurement of the same ground a week apart. That is why this chart draws a bar and the one above it does not.
