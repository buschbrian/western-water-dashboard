/*
 * How much drier or wetter each drainage area got in a week, ranked.
 *
 * ## Why a bar here, when the gap chart refuses one
 *
 * `drought-gap.ts` explains at length why it draws two dots and a line rather
 * than one diverging bar: the two figures it compares divide by different
 * things, so their difference is not a quantity and a bar from a zero
 * baseline would assert that it is.
 *
 * This chart is the case that refusal does not cover. Both numbers here are
 * the same measurement of the same land a week apart — the share of an area
 * at severe drought or worse — so the difference between them is a real
 * quantity in real units, points of land, and zero is a real place on the
 * axis rather than an invented one. A diverging bar from that zero is the
 * honest shape, and it is the one shape that shows direction, size and rank
 * in a single mark.
 *
 * ## Zero is drawn, and it is in the middle
 *
 * The axis is symmetric around zero even when the week is not. A week where
 * everything got wetter would otherwise draw its zero hard against the right
 * edge, and the next week's chart would put it somewhere else — so the same
 * bar length would mean a different number on two consecutive Thursdays. The
 * bound is the largest move in either direction, rounded up, applied both
 * ways.
 *
 * ## Colour
 *
 * From `CHANGE_CLASSES`, the same table the map fills with and the table
 * column reads, so a bar's colour means here exactly what it means there
 * (ADR-008, ADR-032, ADR-074). Nothing on this chart is coloured by anything
 * else: the drought classes are not on it, because this is not a chart about
 * how dry anywhere is.
 *
 * Hand-built SVG for the reasons the other three charts on this page give —
 * a few dozen rows need no chart SDK, and everything that is not data takes
 * its colour from CSS so both themes stay readable.
