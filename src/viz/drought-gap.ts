/*
 * Dry land against banked water, as a ranked list rather than a cloud.
 *
 * The scatter beside this answers the same question and answers it as a
 * relationship: fourteen points, two axes, and the reading a viewer is meant
 * to take is each point's distance from the diagonal where the two shares are
 * equal. That diagonal is not drawn, and even if it were, judging
 * perpendicular distance by eye is a poor way to rank anything. The scatter
 * is kept because a cloud shows the shape of the relationship; this shows the
 * order, which is what a reader who wants a list actually needs.
 *
 * ## Two dots and a line, not one bar
 *
 * The obvious chart here is a diverging bar of `storage - dryness`. It is
 * also wrong, and the reason is worth stating: those two percentages divide
 * by different things. One is a share of land, the other a share of reservoir
 * capacity. Their difference is not a quantity -- there is no such thing as
 * "fifteen points of cushion" -- and a bar drawn from a zero baseline asserts
 * that it is.
 *
 * So both figures are drawn as their own dot on one 0 to 100 axis, with a
 * line joining them. The gap is still the thing the eye reads, because it is
 * the length of the line, but nothing on the chart claims it is a measurement
 * and both real values stay legible and separately labelled.
 *
 * ## Colour
 *
 * The dry dot takes the area's worst class colour from `DROUGHT_CLASSES`, and
 * the water dot takes its storage class colour from the same table the map
 * circles use, so each dot means on this chart exactly what its colour means
 * everywhere else on the site (ADR-008, ADR-032). The joining line is
 * neutral: it is a distance, not a third value, and giving it a colour of its
 * own would invent a category.
 *
 * Hand-built SVG for the same reasons as the scatter and the snow curve --
 * fourteen rows need no chart SDK, and everything that is not data takes its
 * colour from CSS so both themes stay readable.
