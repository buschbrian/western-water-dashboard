/**
 * The bounding box of the drainage areas that hold published reservoirs.
 *
 * The drainage areas are the primary source, so the map's geography comes
 * from them -- but from the ones with reservoirs in them, not from every area
 * drawn. That was the same fourteen areas from ADR-063 until R1
 * (admit-awdb-west) moved `ROSTER_SCOPE` to `west-huc6`, which is why this
 * box now reads as the whole west rather than as Utah's corner of it: the
 * roster was admitted from that scope now, so this is the box of it. So the
 * extent follows the roster and grows when the roster does.
 *
 * A constant rather than a computation because the navigation constraint is
 * needed when the view is constructed, before any boundary file has been
 * fetched -- and a constraint that arrives late is a map that can be panned
 * away in the meantime. `extent.test.ts` recomputes it from whichever file
 * `reference.json` names as the roster scope's, so it cannot drift from the
 * areas it describes and it cannot be left behind when they move.
 *
 * The exact extremes of the committed rings rather than a rounded box. Three
 * decimals cannot express them without either clipping a divide or drifting
 * further from the file than the test's tolerance allows, and this box has to
 * *contain* every polygon. The values moved by about a hundred metres when
 * the boundaries were refetched at 56 metres (ADR-037): finer geometry finds
 * the true extremes that a 500-metre generalization had cut the corners off.
 *
 * **No longer what `MAP_BOUNDS` below is built from.** Before R1 the two
 * questions -- where does the map open, and where was the roster admitted
 * from -- had one answer, so one constant answered both. R1 gave them
 * different answers on purpose: the storage map still has to open on
 * something sane for a reader who has chosen no scope (ADR-044's contract
 * with the retired routes' saved links), while this box is free to move with
 * the roster, including all the way out to the whole west. Collapsing them
 * back into one constant here would have dragged `MAP_BOUNDS` out to 19
 * degrees of longitude the same morning ROSTER_SCOPE moved -- exactly the
 * load the chooser (`src/data/opening-scope.ts`) exists to carry instead.

 * so the opening view could not be corrected without moving a contract that
 * has nothing to do with framing. Splitting them is the same split ADR-068
 * made between the drawn and roster scopes, applied to the last constant
 * that was still answering two questions.
 *
 * The correction it exists for: `MAP_BOUNDS` is the fourteen Utah-connected
 * areas of ADR-063, expanded one zoom level. The roster moved west (R1) and
 * that box did not, so every map opened centred four degrees east of the
 * reservoirs it draws. Measured on the committed roster, opening a phone at

 * west's densest cluster outside it.
 *
 * So the opening view is the areas the maps actually draw. Numerically this
 * is `DRAWN_BOUNDS` today, and it is written out rather than aliased to it:
 * "which areas are drawn" and "where does a page open" are two questions,
 * they have one answer at the moment, and the second must stay free to move
 * -- a margin, a different subject -- without dragging the first with it.

 * Not expanded. A margin is what a wide viewport already gets for free: an
