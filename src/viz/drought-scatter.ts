/*
 * Land conditions against banked water: one point per drainage area, dry land
 * across, stored water up.
 *
 * This is the chart the whole drought view exists to make possible, and the
 * survey found no other product in this category that draws it. Drought maps
 * say how dry the ground is. Reservoir dashboards say how much water is in
 * the bank. Neither says the thing a reader actually wants, which is whether
 * those two agree -- and they routinely do not. An area can be almost
 * entirely in severe drought while its reservoirs are three-quarters full,
 * which is a region living on water it banked in better years, and it can be
 * the other way around after one dry winter following a wet decade.
 *
 * Hand-built SVG like the snow curve and the storage trend, for the same
 * reasons: fourteen points need no chart SDK, the page stays light enough to
 * open on a phone, and everything that is not data takes its colour from CSS
 * so the dark theme keeps the axes readable. Point colours come from
 * `DROUGHT_CLASSES` -- the monitor's own palette, the same one the map and
 * the bars use -- so a point's colour means on this chart exactly what it
 * means everywhere else on the page.
 *
 * The reference lines are drawn at the middle of each axis and are not a
 * judgment: they are there so the four corners can be read as combinations
 * rather than the reader having to hold two numbers in their head. The words
 * for the corners live on the page beside the chart, not in the picture.
