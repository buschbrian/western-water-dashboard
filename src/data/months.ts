 * The twelve months already in the payload, which the modern map has never

 * month's mean storage against the reservoir's own size basis, rather than
 * read off a field -- the payload carries percentages for today only, and
 * using a different denominator for the past would make the slider's colours
 * mean something subtly different from the colours it starts on. Ported from
 * `monthPct` in `shared/reservoir-viz.js` and held against it in
 * `months.test.ts`, so the three engines animate the same drawdown.
 *
 * The basis is the one in force at that month's end, which is the same figure
 * for every reservoir published so far and stops being so the moment one is
 * restricted or enlarged (ADR-111). The frozen oracle divides by today's, so
 * the two agree exactly while a reservoir's full level has one value and are
 * meant to differ once it has two: a dated reservoir is where the port stops
 * being a port.
