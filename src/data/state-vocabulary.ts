/*
 * The state axis: what a reader may pick on the splash screen, and how each
 * surface's own state-shaped field is read.
 *
 * Three surfaces carry a state, in three different attributes, and each is
 * exact for a different reason (docs/INITIAL-SCOPE-SELECTION.md, "The state
 * axis is exact where it matters"):
 *
 *   - `Reservoir.waterbody_states` -- already read by `reservoirInState` in
 *     `overview-model.ts`. Not duplicated here.
 *   - `SnowSite.state` -- one site, one state, read directly by callers.
 *   - `DrainageArea.states` -- a comma-joined string, because a drainage
 *     area's water can reach more than one state. Parsed here.
 *
 * This module does not decide what a reader's chosen state *does* to any of
 * the three surfaces; it only answers what states exist to choose and how to
 * read the one field (`states`) that is not already a plain string or array.
 * Nothing here is a `Scope` -- that name is already taken twice in this tree
 * (`watershed_scopes.py`'s `west-huc6`, `overview-model.ts`'s
 * `{geography, lakePowell}`), and a reader's chosen state is not a third one:
 * it stays a plain two-letter code (or the sentinel `"all"`), exactly the
 * type `reservoirInState`'s `state` parameter already has.
 */

/**
 * The chooser's explicit vocabulary: USPS two-letter codes for the fifty
 * states plus the District of Columbia.
 *
 * `DrainageArea.states` comes from the national Watershed Boundary Dataset,
 * and that attribute's own vocabulary is wider than "state a reader can
 * pick" -- it also carries `MX` and `CN` on the handful of drawn areas whose
 * water crosses a national border (8 into Mexico, 4 into Canada in the
 * committed `west-huc6.geojson`). Those are border markers, not states, and
 * they carry no reservoirs and no snow sites.
 *
 * `offeredStates` below intersects this list against what the data actually
 * holds, rather than trusting "whatever code the attribute contains" -- so a
 * border marker can never reach the chooser no matter what a future payload
 * publishes.
