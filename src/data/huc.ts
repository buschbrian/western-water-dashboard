/*
 * Watershed (HUC6) assignment and capacity-weighted rollups.
 *
 * Phase 1.5 of docs/history/modernization-2026.md. Pure arithmetic and geometry with no
 * DOM, no network and no SDK in it, so all of it is unit-testable -- which
 * is the point: the map pages already draw the HUC6 boundaries live from the
 * USGS service, but nothing yet says which unit a reservoir belongs to, and
 * a wrong assignment is invisible on a map.
 *
 * Two rules from the plan are load-bearing and are enforced here rather than
 * left to callers:
 *
 *   1. A reservoir is assigned by its dam or outlet point. A large reservoir
 *      can span two units; the assignment answers "where does the stored
 *      water leave?", which is one place.
 *   2. A twelve-month HUC value is valid only when *every* tracked reservoir
 *      in that unit has a value for that month. Otherwise the series shows a
 *      gap. This deliberately differs from `statewideMonthly` in
 *      shared/reservoir-viz.js, which sums whatever is present: across 53
 *      reservoirs one missing month barely moves the total, but a unit with
 *      three reservoirs would show a cliff and read as a drought.

 * so on down. So the test is "an even count of digits, at most twelve", which
 * also rejects the five- and seven-digit strings that are not a level at all
 * and would otherwise be waved through by a looser `\d+`.
