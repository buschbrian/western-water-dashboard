/*
 * The reader's opening scope: which state and which drainage area they
 * asked for, narrowed against each other and against what the reference
 * export actually publishes, and the box a map opens on once that
 * narrowing is done.
 *
 * docs/OPENING-SCOPE-AND-THE-WESTERN-ROSTER.md calls this slice S2. It sits
 * between two things that already exist and stays out of both of them:
 *
 *   - `?state=` and `?area=` already travel across the navigation
 *     (`state/portable-url.ts`) and already mean the right things. This
 *     module only reads them; it does not write them, and it does not touch
 *     `state/url.ts`, which S5 owns and holds byte-for-byte parity with the
 *     frozen `shared/reservoir-viz.js`.
 *   - The published unit boxes (`DrainageArea.box`, `unionOfAreaBoxes`) came
 *     from S1. This module is their first caller: it narrows the published
 *     roster down to what a reader's choice actually means and hands the
 *     narrowed set to `unionOfAreaBoxes` for the box a map opens on.
 *
 * No page imports this yet. `main.ts`, `snow.ts`, `drought.ts` and
 * `overview.ts` are slice S3a-d, built in parallel against the API here.
 *
 * A region is a filter, not a drawn level (D2). `?area=14` narrows the same
 * roster `?area=140100` does, at a coarser prefix -- it is never `?level=`,
 * which is a different axis entirely (ADR-064: how finely the ground is
 * *drawn*. Region and subregion are entry vocabulary over basin figures on
 * storage and snow. Drought additionally publishes HUC-8 figures, so its
 * chooser may narrow one tier farther without changing the shared default.
 *
 * The honesty constraint (docs/OPENING-SCOPE-AND-THE-WESTERN-ROSTER.md,
 * "What a state selection is allowed to claim") is the reason this module
 * stops where it does. A state means three different exact things depending
 * on what is being asked about it -- `waterbody_states` for a reservoir,
 * `state` for a snow site, `states` ("the water reaches this state") for a
 * drainage area -- and only the third of those is a question about the
 * *areas* this module narrows. This module resolves `state` and `area` to
 * one small, precise answer and stops; it does not offer a "matches state"
 * function generic enough to be reached for on a reservoir or a snow site,
 * because that is exactly how the wrong exact rule ends up applied to the
 * wrong surface. A caller reads `OpeningScope.selection` and hands it to
 * whichever rule its own surface already has (`reservoirInState` in
 * `overview-model.ts`, `payloadForState` in `snow-model.ts`,
 * `areaReachesState` below, for drainage areas and nothing else).
