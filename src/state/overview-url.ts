/*
 * The overview page's view, as a link.
 *
 * The page had no URL state at all: every filter, every chart control and
 * the cross-filter selection lived only in the DOM, so a reader who found
 * something could not hand it to anybody. Six charts made that worse rather
 * than better -- the more a view can say, the more it is worth sending.
 *
 * Five filter concepts are shared with the map, so a link carries between
 * the two pages. The overview retains its original `area`, `storage` and
 * `reporting` names and also reads the map's documented `drainage`, `class`
 * and `late` names. Both pages are filtering the same reservoirs by the same
 * questions, and each writer canonicalises the aliases it reads.
 *
 * `reporting` is the one whose value sets differ: this page offers daily and
 * monthly as well as late, the map offers current. Each page validates what
 * it understands and falls back to "all" for the rest, which is what makes
 * sharing a name safe -- a link is honoured as far as the receiving page can
 * honour it, and never rejected.
 *
 * The remaining five belong to this page alone. They are written here rather
 * than added to `SELECTION_PARAMS` in url.ts because that table is the set
 * the map *strips and rewrites*: a chart measure listed there would be
 * deleted from any link that passed through the map, and `searchWithState`
 * is held byte-for-byte against the shared module besides.
 *
 * No browser API in the parsing half, for the same reason url.ts has none:
 * the awkward cases are a name with a space in it and a hand-edited link,
 * and both are only testable if the functions take a string and return one.
