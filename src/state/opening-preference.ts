/*
 * The place a returning reader last chose, and which answer wins.
 *
 * Every surface reads `?state=` and `?area=` and a control writes them (S4).
 * This remembers the choice between visits, and that is a smaller feature
 * than it sounds -- almost all of it is deciding what beats what, because a
 * remembered choice and a shared link are two people's intentions arriving
 * at the same page.
 *
 * The order is fixed and there is only one defensible one:
 *
 *   1. The address bar, when it answered. A link is someone showing someone
 *      else a thing, and it must show them that thing. This includes
 *      `state=all` -- see `EVERYWHERE` -- which is how a reader who has Utah
 *      stored can still be sent the whole west.
 *   2. The stored choice, when there is one.
 *   3. Everywhere.
 *
 * What this deliberately does not do is write the reader's stored choice
 * back into the address bar. A silent parameter appearing in a URL the
 * reader is about to copy is how a private preference leaks into a public
 * link; the page narrows to the stored place and the address bar stays as
 * they found it, so what they copy is what they see rather than what they
 * prefer. `?state=all` exists precisely so that "what they see" can be
 * everywhere without being silence.
