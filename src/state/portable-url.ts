 * The parameters that travel with a reader who moves between pages.

 * `?area=` and `?level=` are each one parameter across the whole site by
 * design -- the three maps exist to be compared by flipping between them
 * (ADR-007), and a reader who has narrowed one map and lands on another
 * drawn wide has been given two answers to one question. The navigation is
 * where that promise was being broken: this table built static hrefs, so
 * every parameter was dropped on every click, and `?level=` in particular
 * was documented as shared while the bar silently discarded it.
 *
 * Only the parameters that mean the same thing everywhere are here. A
 * reservoir selection, a sort order, a chart measure and a storage class are
 * each about one page's own subject, and carrying them would be asserting
 * that the receiving page has the same subject.
 *
 * Written in this order rather than the order they appear in the address
 * bar, so the same view always produces the same link.
