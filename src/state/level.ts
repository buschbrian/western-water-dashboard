 * them (ADR-007), and a reader who has chosen subregions on one and lands on
 * another drawn in basins has been given two answers to one question.
 *
 * It carries the digit count -- `?level=4` -- rather than a word, because
 * that is the number every published payload states in its own `level` field
 * and the one `data.html` documents. A reader who sees it in the address bar
 * can look it up.
 *
 * The default is the absence of the parameter, never `level=6`: a shared link
 * should carry what the reader changed and nothing else.
