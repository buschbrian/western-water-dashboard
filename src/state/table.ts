/*
 * The rows under the map, and the order the reader put them in.
 *
 * Pure: reservoirs and a sort go in, rows come out. The renderer in
 * `ui/table.ts` and the CSV writer in `data/export.ts` are both handed the
 * same array, which is what makes "the file contains exactly the rows on
 * screen" a property rather than a promise -- there is no second query for
 * the export to get subtly wrong.
 *
 * WHY THE TABLE NARROWS WHERE THE MAP DIMS
 *
 * The map greys excluded reservoirs and keeps them (see `filters.ts`),
 * because removing a circle from a map removes the geography around it too.
 * A table has no geography to lose, and a sorted table with excluded rows
 * left in it interleaves them through the order the reader just asked for.
 * So the table lists what the filter matches, says how many of how many, and
 * the panel list beside it keeps every reservoir in scope operable -- which
 * is where the keyboard path and ADR-020's reachability actually live.
 * Recorded as ADR-029.
