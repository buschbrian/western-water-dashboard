        by AI agents working from stated requirements. A person reviews every change,
        the change is tested, and the project's decision records keep it. The code, the daily pipeline and every decision behind them are public. A

        <dt>Snow measurements</dt>
        <dd>Daily snow water equivalent for the mountain sites on the snowpack page. It
        comes from the same Natural Resources Conservation Service water and climate
        service as the storage readings. Each reading is compared with the middle value for the
          same day in the years 1991 through 2020, the standard comparison period that
          service publishes.
          <br /><strong>A drainage area's snow figure is the plain average of the sites
          reporting in it, and every site counts once.</strong> It is a figure about the
          measuring sites, not a measure of the snow lying across the whole area. The sites
          are placed where snow can be measured reliably. That is neither evenly across the
          land nor evenly up the mountainside. An area with four sites and an area with
          thirty are each an average of what they have. Every area's figure is published
          with the number of sites reporting that day. No area is given a figure until at
          least two sites report.
          <br /><strong>Early and late in the season, a percent of normal means very
          little.</strong> In October the usual amount of snow for the date is close to
          zero. A small amount of new snow divided by it gives a very large percentage. On
          27 October 2025, 147 sites reported and the figure was 266% of normal, against a
          usual amount of about a quarter of an inch. There was almost no snow and almost
          no usual snow. Where the usual amount for the date is below one inch, this site
          leads with the depth of water in the snow instead. The season curve still draws
          the percentage, because that is where the shape of a season is read.</dd>

          National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
          <br /><strong>The map is a judgement, not a reading.</strong> Authors draw it
          each week by weighing many kinds of evidence together. Those include rain and
          snow records, soil moisture and streamflow. They also include reservoir and
          groundwater levels, satellite pictures of vegetation, and reports from people on
          the ground. The authors then agree on where each class belongs. It is the most careful summary of drought available,
          and it is not a single instrument reading like the other numbers here.
          <br /><strong>The first class is not drought.</strong> D0 means abnormally dry.
          D1 to D4 are the drought classes, from moderate to exceptional. Where this site
          counts areas in drought, it counts D1 and worse, and any figure that includes D0
          says so.
          <br />The drawn areas are downloaded each week. The share of each drainage area's
          land in each class is worked out from them by this project. That share is this
          site's own calculation, not a figure the monitor publishes. Read the source at

      <ol class="methods-steps">
        <li><strong>Once every morning.</strong> A scheduled job starts at 12:00
        Coordinated Universal Time. That is 6 in the morning mountain daylight time, and 5
        in the morning mountain standard time. It asks each provider for the newest
        readings for every reservoir in the inventory.</li>
        <li><strong>Each reservoir is requested by a fixed identifier.</strong> The refresh script holds the identifiers and does not discover them at run
        time. It makes the same request every day, so a reservoir cannot quietly
        change meaning between one morning and the next.</li>
        <li><strong>A failed request is retried, then given up on.</strong> If a provider
          cannot be reached, the reservoir keeps its last known reading and is marked as
          having late data. It is never dropped from the map and its old value is never
          presented as today's.</li>
        <li><strong>Every value is checked before it is published.</strong> The complete
          payload is validated against the shape the pages expect. A payload that fails is
          not published, so the site keeps yesterday's numbers rather than showing
          something unchecked.</li>
        <li><strong>The published file is the release.</strong> The checked data is
          committed to the repository, and that commit is what publishes the site. There is
          no separate database, and no step between what was checked and what you are
          reading.</li>
        <li><strong>Reservoirs whose readings stop are reported in public.</strong> When a
          feed goes quiet the refresh opens an issue in the repository listing the affected
          reservoirs, and closes it again when they resume.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The pages themselves fetch that file when they load. They never receive it as part
        of their own code, which is what lets the numbers change every morning without the
        site being rebuilt.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="methods-section" id="values" aria-labelledby="values-heading">
      <h2 id="values-heading">How each value is worked out</h2>
      <dl class="methods-list">
        <dt>Percent full</dt>
        <dd>Storage now, divided by the full level. The full level is the reservoir's
          capacity where a traceable capacity exists. Where it does not, the site uses the highest storage recorded since 2015
        instead. The reservoir details say which of the two the percentage measures
        against.</dd>
        <dt>Which full level</dt>
        <dd>Three different full levels reach this site, and they do not mean the same
          thing. A <strong>normal full level</strong> is the amount a reservoir is operated
          to hold. A <strong>maximum level</strong> includes storage above that, which is
          kept empty to catch a flood and is not meant to be occupied. A third group carries
          the full level the water and climate service publishes beside its readings. Each
          reservoir's details name the one used for it.
          <br />This matters most where it is least visible. A reservoir measured against
          a maximum level reads lower than the same reservoir measured against a normal
          one. So a combined percentage that adds the three kinds together is slightly
          lower than a single basis would give. Lake Powell is measured against a maximum
          level, which is why its share of any total it enters matters.
          <span data-live="basis-mix"></span>
          We publish the basis rather than silently converting between them, because
          converting would mean inventing numbers the dam owners have not published.</dd>
        <dt>Normal for this week</dt>
        <dd>The middle value of readings taken within seven days before or after the same
          date in earlier years. It answers "is this a normal amount of water for the time
          of year". Percent full on its own cannot: the same percentage means
          different things in April and in September.
          <br /><strong>You choose which years.</strong> The storage map has a "Compare against" control with two periods. Each
        reservoir says which one its number came from, and how many years stand behind
        it.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1991 through 2020</strong> is the thirty-year period the World
              Meteorological Organization defines as standard, and the same period the
              mountain snow measurements use. The map opens on it. The site builds it once from the full provider records and keeps it in the
        repository. A middle value over a period that ended cannot change.</li>
            <li><strong>2015 through last year</strong> is every year this site collects.
              Those years were unusually dry here, so a reservoir can look ordinary against them and still be low.</li>
          </ul>
          <span data-live="climate-coverage"></span>
          The standard period is built from the full provider record, one reservoir at a
          time. The roster has grown faster than that record has been built. A reservoir
          without it says so in its details. It gives the other period's value instead of a
          middle value taken from three or four years. Some
          reservoirs are simply newer than the period: Jackson Flat's dam dates from
          2017.</dd>
        <dt>History rank</dt>
        <dd>How this reading compares with readings near the same date in earlier years.
          90% means it is higher than 90% of them. The current year is not counted against
          itself.
          <br />The record starts in 2015, so every rank rests on eight to eleven earlier
          years. That is a small number to take a position in, and two ranks a few points
          apart are not meaningfully different. Each reservoir's details give the number of
          years its own rank was taken from. Treat a rank as an indication of where a
          reading sits, not as a measurement.</dd>
        <dt>Change</dt>
        <dd>The difference between the newest reading and the reading nearest 7, 30 or 365
        days before it. Shown where the provider publishes often enough to support
        it.</dd>
        <dt>The last 12 months</dt>
        <dd>For each month, the average, lowest, highest and closing storage, and the normal
          value for that month against whichever period is selected. The chart in the
          reservoir details shows the average, and the percentages under it use the same
          full level the map colours by. A monthly normal value is the middle of that calendar month's average storage
        across the years in the period. A reservoir read once a month and one read
        every day therefore carry the same weight.</dd>
        <dt>Combined percentages</dt>
        <dd>Storage added up across reservoirs, divided by their full levels added up. A large reservoir therefore counts for more than a small one. That is why Lake
        Powell has its own control: it is large enough to hide local conditions inside
        a single total. The same is true of Lake Mead, which has its own control for the
        same reason. Both start included, and every page states which of the two the
        figure beside it holds.
          <br /><strong>A combined figure is the newest reading from each reservoir, and
          those readings were not all taken on the same day.</strong> Some providers
          publish every day and some publish once a month. So a total can hold yesterday's
          reading beside a month-end reading several weeks old. It is the newest picture
          available rather than a picture of one moment. Every page that shows a combined
          figure says how many reservoirs are behind it. It also says how much of the
          combined full level was read on time. And it gives the range of dates the
          readings span.
          <br /><strong>The full levels added up do not all mean the same thing.</strong>
          They are the kinds described above, plus the figure a water service publishes
          beside its readings where it publishes one. Which kind stands behind each
          reservoir is recorded in the published data, in the field named
          &quot;capacity_basis&quot;. So the combined figure is storage against the full
          levels this site can trace. It is not storage against one single definition of
          full. Each page that shows one can say how that total divides between the
          kinds.</dd>
        <dt>Late data</dt>
        <dd>A reading is late when it is older than the schedule its provider publishes on.
        That is more than two days for daily readings, and more than 45 days for
        month-end readings.
          Late reservoirs stay on the map, marked, with the date of the reading they
          carry.</dd>

      <h2 id="scope-heading">Which reservoirs are included</h2>
      <p><strong>A reservoir is placed in a drainage area by its dam or outlet point,
        not by the middle of its water surface.</strong> A large reservoir can cross a
        boundary, and what matters is where the stored water leaves it. That area is
        called the reservoir's <strong>outlet drainage area</strong> on this site.</p>
      <p><strong>An outlet drainage area is not the land that fills the reservoir.</strong>
        It is the area holding the dam, and it is used to put each reservoir in exactly one
        group. Large western reservoirs collect water from many areas upstream, and some
        also receive water carried in from another river system altogether. So this site
        sometimes shows a reservoir beside the snow or drought conditions of its own area.
        Read those as conditions near the dam. They are not a measure of everything that
        fills the reservoir.</p>
      <p>The maps draw every drainage area of the west. That is all the land that drains
        to the Pacific Ocean, and the Great Basin, whose water reaches no ocean at
        all. That is
        75 areas. Drought is measured for all of them.</p>
      <p>Each map offers two area sizes, and the reader chooses. Basins are the smaller
        of the two, 75 of them, and are what a map opens with. Subregions are larger and
        there are 44; each one holds whole basins, so nothing is split by the choice.
        Every figure on the page is measured again at the size chosen. The drought shares cover the larger areas, and the reservoir totals add up
        over them. The snow figures are the mean over the same measurement sites in a
        different grouping. No figure is an average of the smaller areas' figures.</p>
      <p><strong>A reservoir is included when one of the two federal programmes above
        publishes its storage, and this project can trace a full level for it.</strong>
        There is no separate geographic test beyond the west itself. The roster used to be
        narrower — a reservoir had to be connected to Utah by drainage — and it is not any
        more.</p>
      <p data-live="scope-counts" class="methods-live"></p>
      <p><strong>These are the reservoirs this site tracks. They are not all the stored
        water in the west.</strong> The two federal programmes cover the large federal
        projects well and cover other reservoirs unevenly. Several states publish their own
        reservoir records that this site does not yet read. A drainage area can therefore
        hold much more stored water than the total here shows. Read every combined figure on
        this site as a figure about the reservoirs it names.</p>
      <p>The maps and tables can narrow the list by state, and that filter follows the
        water. Where a reservoir's water reaches a state, it is counted in that state's
        list. That holds even when the provider's published point sits over the border.
        Utah is one of those choices, not the subject of the site.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="methods-section" id="coverage" aria-labelledby="coverage-heading">
      <h2 id="coverage-heading">How complete this is</h2>
      <p>The two federal programmes cover the large federal projects well. They cover
        everything else unevenly, so the reservoirs this site tracks and the stored water
        in a state are different quantities. In some states they are very different.</p>
      <p>The table says what this site holds for each state, and what it is known to be
        missing. A state is counted here the way the state filter counts it: where a
        reservoir's water reaches a state, it is in that state's row. So a reservoir on a

      <h2 id="limits-heading">What this data cannot tell you</h2>
      <ul class="methods-plain">
        <li>These are the reservoirs this dashboard tracks, not all the water in a drainage
          area. Rivers, snowpack, groundwater and untracked reservoirs are not counted.</li>
        <li>Published values are provisional. A provider can revise a reading after the
          fact, and the next morning's refresh will carry the revision.</li>
        <li>A full level taken from the highest storage since 2015 is a floor, not a
        capacity. A reservoir that never filled in that period reads higher than it
        would against its true capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>The years you compare against change the answer, and by a lot.</strong>
          Lake Powell in August 2026 is at 44.6% of normal measured against 2015 through
          2025, and at 35.0% measured against 1991 through 2020. Both are correct. The
          second is the standard period; the first is measured against a decade of drought,
          which is a lower bar. The map opens on the standard period for that reason, and
          every comparison on the site names the years it used.</li>
        <li>The history rank is a separate measure and always uses the years this site
          collects, which start in 2015. It is not affected by the "Compare against"
          control. A rank therefore rests on eight to eleven years however the normal value
          beside it is measured.</li>
        <li>A full level taken from the highest storage since 2015 is still a floor rather
          than a capacity, whichever period the normal value uses. The two are different
          denominators answering different questions.</li>
        <li><strong>These reservoirs are operated, and much of what the numbers show is
          operation rather than weather.</strong> Water is released to meet downstream
          deliveries, power generation, environmental flows and obligations between states.
          A reservoir can fall through a wet month because it is releasing water, and hold
          steady through a dry one because it is not. Storage is the result of what arrived
          and what was let out, and this site publishes only the result. Do not read a
          falling reservoir as a drying watershed without checking what was released.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage and drought are not independent of each other.</strong> The
          Drought Monitor's authors already weigh water-supply conditions, including
          reservoir and streamflow records, when they draw the map. So a chart putting
          storage beside drought class shows how two related pictures line up. It is not a
          test of one against the other.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage and drought can disagree for good reasons.</strong> A reservoir
          holds water that arrived in earlier years, and receives water from land far
          upstream. It is emptied and filled by decisions, not by weather alone. A full
          reservoir in a dry area, or an empty one in a wet area, is an ordinary result
          rather than a contradiction.</li>
        <li><strong>The colours are display bands, not thresholds.</strong> The storage map
          divides percent full into equal bands so the map can be read at a glance. They do
          not mark a drought declaration, a shortage trigger, an operating rule or a safety
          level. The snow map's bands follow the comparison ranges the snow service
          commonly uses. One extra division is added so the highest values can be told
          apart.</li>
        <li><strong>This site measures water supply, not the health of a river or a
          lake.</strong> It carries three things: how much water is stored, how much is
          lying as mountain snow, and how dry the land is. A full reservoir is not a
          healthy river, and a dry drainage area is not a failing one. Water temperature,
          streamflow, groundwater, water quality and the condition of habitat are all
          absent, and nothing here should be read as standing in for them.</li>
        <li>Nothing here is a forecast. Every number is a measurement, a published
          assessment, or an arithmetic comparison of those.</li>
