/*
 * The drought map: the U.S. Drought Monitor's national polygons in the
 * monitor's own palette, under the drainage-area outlines.
 *
 * This map lives on the drought view, never on the reservoir map, keeping
 * one colour language per map. The polygons are the committed weekly
 * download the coverage figures were computed from, so the paint and the
 * bars describe the same week by construction. The national sweep is drawn
 * whole -- drought does not stop at the region's edge, and seeing the
 * region inside the wider pattern is context the bars cannot give -- while
 * the outlines say which land the figures below describe.
 *
 * State outlines and, once the reader is close enough for them to mean
 * anything, county outlines come from the authoritative hosted services
 * rather than committed copies (`arcgis/reference-layers.ts`). The national
 * sweep is the reason: a drought pattern drawn across the whole West needs
 * something that says which West, and the coverage figures below do not
 * depend on those boundaries in any way, so a service that may simply not
 * answer is the right kind of dependency for them.
 *
 * The reservoirs are drawn over both as neutral labelled reference points.
 * They carry no storage colour: the monitor's palette owns this map. What
 * they add is the join the page is built around, made visible rather than
 * only tabulated -- a reader can see which reservoirs sit inside the D4
 * patch instead of matching two lists of drainage-area names by eye.
