/*
 * What every gallery-less view map shares: the element shape, the control
 * set, the framing and navigation bounds, the bounded wait for a WebGL
 * view, and the palette-to-fill conversion. Written once for the snow and
 * drought maps -- the framing especially, because a written zoom snaps to
 * an integer and one step out spans a continent, and that lesson should not
 * need relearning per map.
 *
 * The framing is deliberately the storage map's own: the same region
 * extent, the same minimum and maximum zoom, and the same refusal to leave
 * the region. Three maps of the same drainage areas that each open
 * at a different box are three maps a reader cannot compare by flipping
 * between them, and a map that can be panned into the Pacific is one a
 * reader can only recover from by reloading the page.

   * not have the storage map's height. All six controls in one top-right
   * stack is the storage map's arrangement, and it measures about 240px --
   * fine down the edge of a full-viewport map, most of the height of a
   * 416px card, and past it once the phone layout shortens the card
   * further. A stack the card cannot hold does not scroll; it collides
   * with the scale bar in the corner below it.
   *
   * So the right edge keeps only navigation -- zoom, then home, then
   * compass, the things a reader lost in the map reaches for -- and the
   * appearance controls (the background gallery and fullscreen) take the
   * top-left corner, which on these cards nothing else owns: the legend
   * sits at the *bottom* left, and the two meet only if the card shrinks
   * below anything the suite tests. Zoom is included at all because a map
   * component adds none of its own: without it the only way to zoom is the
   * scroll wheel, which is no way at all on a trackpad inside a scrolling
   * page.
   *
   * Locate is deliberately not here. These views are constrained to the
   * drainage region -- a reader outside it (which is nearly every reader of
   * a public dashboard) taps it and the view either refuses or leaves the
   * region it cannot leave; an error with a button on it. The storage map
   * keeps it for the reader standing on a reservoir; a 416px context card
   * does not need to know where the reader is standing.
   *
   * The basemap gallery is here now, and was left out before for a reason
   * that has since been dealt with: these maps follow the page theme, so a
   * background the reader picks had to be protected from the next theme
   * swap. `followThemeBasemap` now holds the identity of what it last
   * assigned and stands down once the map is wearing something else -- the
   * same guard the storage map has always had. */
