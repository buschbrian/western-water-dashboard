/*
 * The snow map: drainage areas filled by their mean percent of normal for
 * one day of the water year, with every measurement site as a point reading
 * on the same scale (the one idiom the agency's own map gets right, adopted
 * by the external product review in the modernization plan).
 *
 * Graphics, not FeatureLayers: fourteen polygons and two hundred points that
 * change symbol when the day changes are cheaper to hold as graphics than to
 * rebuild as a layer, and none of the storage map's renderer machinery is
 * needed. Colours come from `SNOW_CLASSES` only.
 *
 * The reservoirs are deliberately *not* drawn here, and were removed on
 * 2026-08-16 after being tried. This map already carries fourteen filled
 * basins and two hundred and seventeen site markers on one scale, and sixty
 * nine more points with names beside them buried the readings the page
 * exists to show. They earn their place on the drought map, which has five
 * broad national classes and room for them, and they have a whole map of
 * their own besides. Density is the argument, not principle: the same points
 * are good context there and noise here.
