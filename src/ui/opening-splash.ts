/*
 * The first-visit question: where, and what.
 *
 * A reader arriving with no link and no remembered place lands on the whole
 * west -- 75 drainage areas, eleven states, and about two hundred reservoirs.
 * That is the honest default and it is a lot to be handed. This asks the two
 * questions that turn it into the page they wanted, and gets out of the way.
 *
 * ## When it appears, which is the constraint everything else bends to
 *
 * Only when nothing else has answered: no `?state=`, no `?area=`, no stored
 * place, and not dismissed before. **A shared link never lands on an
 * interstitial** -- someone opening a colleague's link is being shown a
 * thing, and a dialog in front of it is a worse version of the page they
 * were sent. `resolveOpeningPlace` already reports which of those answered,
 * so this reads its `source` rather than re-deriving the rule.
 *
 * ## Two decisions, taken here rather than left implicit
 *
 * **States and regions are one list, not two tabs.** Sixteen choices is a
 * lot at 360 pixels, which is the argument for tabs, and it is the wrong
 * argument: a tab hides half the answers behind an interaction a reader has
 * to guess is there. Two headed groups in one scrolling column shows every
 * choice at every width and costs a scroll instead of a discovery.
 *
 * **No counts on the tiles, for now.** The design that ordered this wanted
 * "eleven reservoirs, eighty-five snow sites" beside each place, and that is
 * genuinely better -- it is what makes offering a state with no reservoirs
 * obviously right rather than apparently broken. It needs all three payloads,
 * and a dialog that waits on three fetches is an interstitial that arrives
 * late, which is the one thing this shape must not be. So it opens on what
 * `reference.json` already answers -- which places exist and what they are
 * called -- and the counts wait for a way to have them without the wait.
 *
 * ## Not Calcite
 *
 * A native `<dialog>`: it traps focus, closes on Escape, and exposes a real
 * accessible name without a shadow root between the label and the control.
 * Calcite's own switch was refused by axe-core at all three widths earlier in
 * this feature's life for exactly that reason, and the filter bars this sits
 * beside already hold native controls.
