/*
 * State and county boundaries, from the authoritative hosted services rather
 * than from committed copies.
 *
 * This is the plan's own rule for optional map context: prefer a public REST
 * layer when it has a bounded failure path, and keep committed files for the
 * reviewed assignments and the daily numbers. These boundaries are neither
 * -- nothing on any page is computed from them, no figure moves if Esri
 * regeneralizes a coastline -- so a service is right and a third megabyte of
 * committed GeoJSON would be wrong.
 *
 * The bounded failure path is the condition, so it is enforced here rather
 * than assumed. Each layer is loaded against a deadline before it is put on
 * a map, and a layer that does not answer is simply not added: the drought
 * sweep, the drainage outlines, the reservoirs and every figure on the page
 * are already drawn from local data, so losing the state outlines costs
 * context and nothing else. A `FeatureLayer` added and left to fail on its
 * own would instead sit in the layer list forever, unloaded and unexplained.
 *
 * Both services are anonymous-readable and were verified as such before
 * being written down; the anonymous auth policy the shell installs is what
 * keeps a change on Esri's side from turning into a sign-in dialog for a
 * reader who has no ArcGIS account.

/*
 * The full-resolution boundaries, not the generalized ones -- measured, not
 * assumed.
 *
 * The generalized layers look like the obvious choice for decoration: fetched
 * whole they are 19 to 90 times lighter, and a 41-vertex Utah draws the same
 * as a 1,009-vertex one at continental scale. But a `FeatureLayer` never
 * fetches a layer whole. It asks for the current view, quantized to the
 * current resolution, and quantization discards exactly the vertices
 * generalization would have -- so the saving is spent before it is banked.
 *
 * Measured with `tools/audit-transfer.mjs` on the drought page, which draws
 * both layers, twice each and reproducible to the kilobyte:
 *
 *              requests   from this host
 *   detailed         22          511 KiB
 *   generalized      17          534 KiB
 *
 * The detailed layers are *cheaper* on the wire here, and the difference
 * either way is under 4% of what the page fetches from other hosts.
 *
 * Counties carry a second argument that is about correctness rather than
 * cost. ADR-058 requires the detailed layer for the assignment in
 * `counties.json`, because the generalized one puts Lost Lake outside
 * Wasatch County. Drawing the generalized outline meant the line on the map
 * disagreed with the source the reservoir's county came from -- a reservoir
 * could sit visibly outside the county this site says it is in.
