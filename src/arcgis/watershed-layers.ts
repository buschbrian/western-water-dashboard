/*
 * The drainage areas, drawn from the hosted Watershed Boundary Dataset.
 *
 * ## Why this replaces a committed file
 *
 * The boundaries used to reach the browser inside `reference.json`: 982 KB of
 * the file's 1,001 KB, fetched whole on every map page and then walked
 * coordinate by coordinate on the main thread to type-check it.
 *
 * A hosted feature layer is not a smaller version of that. It is a different
 * transaction: the SDK asks for the features in the current view, quantized
 * to the resolution that view can actually show, in a binary format. Measured
 * against this layer for the fourteen published basins:
 *
 *     view          committed     hosted, quantized
 *     ~1:18,000,000   982 KB          12 KB
 *     ~1:9,000,000    982 KB          24 KB
 *     ~1:4,600,000    982 KB          47 KB
 *     ~1:1,200,000    982 KB         176 KB
 *
 * So the wide view costs about a fortieth of the file, and what it costs
 * follows the viewport rather than the size of the scope -- which is the
 * property that makes a western scope possible at all. The same fourteen
 * basins fetched in bulk without quantization are 935 KB as binary and 4.7 MB
 * as JSON, so the saving is the quantization, not the hosting.
 *
 * Note this layer ignores `maxAllowableOffset` -- every offset from 56 m to
 * 2 km returns byte-identical results. Generalization is not the lever here;
 * quantization is, and the SDK applies it from the view without being asked.
 *
 * ## Which service
 *
 * Esri's Living Atlas publishes one layer per hydrologic level, all public
 * and anonymous, on the same organisation this project already draws its
 * state and county boundaries from (ADR-034). So the content policy already
 * allows the host, ADR-004's no-API-key rule is untouched, and the failure
 * mode is one the project already handles: a layer that does not answer in
 * time resolves to null and the map draws without it.

/**
 * Where each hydrologic level's outlines come from.
 *
 * Two publishers of one dataset, which is a state worth explaining rather
 * than tidying over.
 *
 * **Level 2 is the USGS service** at `hydro.nationalmap.gov`, which is the
 * Watershed Boundary Dataset's own publisher and the service this project's
 * pipeline already computes every scope and every drought coverage figure
 * from (`watershed_scopes.py`). It serves all nine levels, answers anonymous
 * browser requests with `access-control-allow-origin: *`, and supports both
 * of the properties the note above is about: `supportsCoordinatesQuantization`
 * is true and PBF is among its query formats, so the view-quantized binary
 * request this layer depends on works there exactly as it does below.
 *
 * **Levels 4, 6 and 8 are Esri's Living Atlas republication**, chosen in
 * ADR-034 before the authoritative service was reached for, and left alone
 * here because moving them is a change to what every existing map draws
 * rather than an addition. The two agree: queried for Colorado Headwaters
 * both return the identical extent to five decimal places. They differ in
 * resolution -- USGS returns 2,180 vertices for that basin against Esri's
 * 31,977, generalized for a map service -- which is ample at the scales this
 * site draws and cheaper, but it is a visible change and belongs in its own
 * commit with its own before and after.
