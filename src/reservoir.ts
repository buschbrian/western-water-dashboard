/*
 * The one-reservoir page: a static shell, the runtime payload, and nothing
 * generated.
 *
 * The shape was decided before it was built (docs/OPEN-BACKLOG-SCOPING.md,
 * decision 4): one entry at `reservoir.html?name=...` rather than a build-time
 * shell per reservoir. The page fetches like every other surface here
 * (ADR-002), and because it reads the *published payload* rather than a
 * generated file, a reservoir withdrawn for a quiet feed (ADR-056) still has
 * a page -- one that says the reading was withdrawn instead of one that
 * stopped existing.
 *
 * What is live on this page is everything about the named reservoir; what is
 * text is the rules. As on the methods page, a page that states a number
 * about the data fills that number from the data.
 *
 * ADR-006 applies to every word of the template and of the model's rows.
