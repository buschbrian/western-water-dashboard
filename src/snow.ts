/**
 * The payload narrowed by the reader's opening scope -- `?state=` and
 * `?area=` together, already resolved against the published rosters and
 * coarsest-first fallback rules (`resolveOpeningScope`).
 *
 * `level` is this page's own grouping (`?level=`, ADR-064), independent of
 * `selection.area` -- a shared link can carry a six-digit basin while this
 * page draws at level four, and `withinOpeningArea` refuses to test a
 * shorter code against a longer selection rather than silently answering
 * "no match" for every record. `areaAtLevel` is what keeps that refusal
 * from ever firing here: the reader named a place and (elsewhere) a
 * granularity, and the place survives at the granularity this page is
 * actually drawing, coarsened, never refined upward.
 *
 * State narrows first, through `payloadForState`, which is the one place
 * the honesty rule is written: it regroups every surviving area's mean from
 * that area's own surviving *sites*, never by re-averaging the published
 * basin means (ADR-064; the module doc's "honesty constraint" names this as
 * the reason `resolveOpeningScope`'s own `state` axis stops at drainage
 * areas and leaves reservoirs and snow sites to their own exact rules).
 *
 * Area narrows second and needs no recompute of its own. `payloadForState`
 * has already rebuilt every surviving area's mean from its own sites, and
 * `payloadAtLevel`/`payloadForState` both group sites by their own exact
 * drainage-area code -- so a site inside an area that survives this second,
 * prefix-matched pass was never partially excluded from it. Dropping whole
 * areas that do not match the chosen region, subregion or basin changes
 * *which* means are shown, never what any surviving one means. A basin
 * whose mean already read `null` below the reporting floor keeps reading
 * `null` here -- this pass only removes areas, it never touches a series.
 *
 * Skipped entirely when the level-coarsened code already names one of this
 * level's own areas exactly: this page's own drainage-area picker
 * (`choices`, `currentArea`, below) already narrows precisely to a code
 * like that, and collapsing the payload here as well would make
 * `payload.site_count` -- this page's own "of N sites" total -- equal the
 * one narrowed area's count permanently, with no way for the picker's
 * "whole region" option to widen back out again. That exact case is the
 * ordinary, long-supported single-basin link this page has always carried;
 * only a code coarser than this level's own grouping -- a region, or a
 * subregion when this level's own areas are basins -- has no representation
 * in `choices` at all, and that is the case this pass exists for.
