"""Every constant the reservoir pipeline is configured by, and today's date.

Paths, thresholds, schema and method versions, the reviewed source-coverage

here fetches, computes or decides; it is the set of numbers and names the rest
of the pipeline is measured against, in one place so that changing one is a
visible, reviewable act.

Two of them are load-bearing in a way their type does not show:
`METHOD_VERSION` names the estimator behind the derived numbers and

#
# Being late and being from another season are different faults, and the
# second one is not fixed by a label. `carry_forward` keeps publishing the
# last known value because a point vanishing from the map with no explanation
# is worse than a point that says it is a few days behind -- that is right,
# and it stays right, for a gap measured in days.
#
# It stops being right somewhere before two months. A May reading standing in
# an August column is not a late measurement of August, it is an accurate
# measurement of spring, and the difference between those is most of the melt.
# Storage here is strongly seasonal: it is the same reason the seasonal
# normal compares a date against the same date in prior years instead of
# against an annual mean. Worse, `statewideRollup` sums `current_storage_af`
# across the scope with no freshness filter, so a carried-forward spring
# figure is not merely displayed out of season, it is added into a regional
# total presented as now.
#
# 60 days rather than a strict calendar two months because the threshold has
# to clear a month-end feed that has missed one publication: such a feed can
# legitimately reach about 45 days (AWDB_MONTHLY_STALE_AFTER_DAYS) before
# anything is wrong, and 60 leaves it room without letting a whole season

# modern record here. A reservoir measured against it is measured against the
# drought, so a bad year reads as ordinary. The snowpack half of the site has
# always used 1991-2020, so this also makes one dashboard use one definition
# of normal. Change this one constant to open on the recent baseline instead;

# than slipped in -- a name cannot key a roster that holds two Lost Creeks,
# and a consumer indexing by name should be told rather than left to find a
# key it knows has quietly become a different reservoir's.
#

# any more, and a reader still expecting the field should be told rather than

#: and two medians taken different ways are not a comparison.
#:
#: "-1" was the same annual estimator on `dayofyear`, where a calendar date
#: took two different positions depending on whether its year was a leap year.
#: "-2" matches on `canonical_day`, so a window centred on 19 August holds
#: every 19 August.
#: "-3" attributes each reading the year-end wrap keeps to the window

# IMPROVEMENT: this mapping is hand-maintained and has no verification step.
# If Reclamation retires a catalog item (which is one of the plausible

# in Utah and another in Oregon, 946 km apart, and a name-keyed roster cannot
# hold both -- the second silently becomes the first, with its capacity, its
# climate normal and its link (ADR-066). The id is what the payload already
# publishes as `source_station_id`, and ADR-003 already calls it the stable
