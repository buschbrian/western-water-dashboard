# Pipeline architecture

The Python side: two daily refreshes, a weekly drought computation, and a set
of on-demand builders and audits. Scoped agent rules are in
[`.claude/rules/python-pipeline.md`](../../.claude/rules/python-pipeline.md)
and [`tools/AGENTS.md`](../../tools/AGENTS.md).

## Modules

`refresh_reservoirs.py` is the **orchestrator**. Read it first: it is the
sequence, not the arithmetic. The specialised concerns live behind named
modules in `pipeline/`:

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `pipeline/constants.py` | Paths, thresholds, schema and method versions, source-coverage review. |
| `pipeline/roster.py` | The committed rosters, capacity evidence and the full-level precedence rule. |
| `pipeline/providers.py` | One adapter per provider: Reclamation, the Conservation Service, the Geological Survey, California, Colorado, Salt River Project, Montana DNRC, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Central Arizona Project (Lake Pleasant, one current record a day; ADR-104). The Geological Survey adapter uses its modern OGC daily collection and a pipeline-only key; the Corps adapter reads the CWMS Data API under the Northwestern Division's Pacific Northwest region office (ADR-102). |
| `pipeline/seasonal.py` | The seasonal estimator: window, annual votes, normals, rank, percentile. |
| `pipeline/freshness.py` | Carry-forward, the withdrawal threshold and the withdrawal notice. |
| `pipeline/geography.py` | County and drainage-area assignment onto finished records. |
| `refresh_reservoirs.py` | Fetch, summarize, assemble, validate, write, and report to CI. |

`refresh_reservoirs` re-exports every public name from those modules, so
`import refresh_reservoirs as R` still reaches all of them and no tool or test
had to learn a new import path.

Other entry points: `refresh_snowpack.py` (snow payload), `watershed_scopes.py`
and `huc.py` (named scopes, drainage assignment, grouping), `admission.py`
(candidate screening), `tools/` (audits, boundary fetches, drought
computation, normals).

## Runtime data contract

For an approved point correction, `refresh_reservoirs.py --rebuild-points
STATION_ID` takes selected coordinates from the reviewed roster and rebuilds
geography through `pipeline.geography.rebuild_published_points` (ADR-108).
It uses committed county and outlet assignments, so county changes must be
reviewed and rebuilt first. It preserves the storage observations and refresh
timestamp, and refuses IDs that are unknown or absent from the current payload.

Committed dam-point rejections in `pipeline.roster` apply to the capacity
builder, its legacy point-repair tool and the runtime loader (ADR-109). They
remove coordinate fields while retaining capacity evidence. The upstream
builder records an explicitly rejected outlet as `unreviewed_outlet`; it does
not infer the whole reservoir basin from a snap inside the lake.

A full level that changed is committed as `capacity_versions` on the
reservoir's capacity evidence, oldest first (ADR-111). Each version runs from
its own `effective_from` until the next one begins, so an observation falls in
exactly one; `effective_to` repeats a boundary the successor already sets. The
earliest version either opens the record with a null start or names the date it
really began, which may be years before the first reading — Tinemaha has been
restricted since 1993 and reports from 2015. A reviewed date is not discarded
to fit a rule, so `check_capacity_versions_cover` proves the other half at
refresh time, where the readings are known: a series that begins before the
earliest full level takes effect fails the run rather than being divided by the
nearest figure to hand. That is also what catches evidence which was complete
when reviewed and stopped covering the record after a backfill. A lone version
must carry a start date, or it is the headline figure written twice. `pipeline.roster.effective_capacity` picks the version
in force on the reading date, which is what the record's flat `capacity_af`,
`capacity_basis` and `pct_of_capacity` publish, and
`published_capacity_history` emits the array as `capacity_history` beside
`physical_capacity_af` — only for a reservoir whose level changed, because a
history repeating one figure is `capacity_af` written twice. The
`operating_restriction` basis is the one that cannot stand alone: a limit
applies from a date, names the authority that set it and where that was read,
and never replaces the physical capacity beside it.

**Data is fetched at runtime, never imported** (ADR-002). `reservoirs.json` is
rewritten every morning and that commit *is* the deploy. The build copies it;
nothing imports it. *Enforced:* `src/deploy.test.ts` and a `dist/assets` grep
in the Pages workflow.

**Measure payload cost gzipped, never raw** (ADR-051, ADR-052). GitHub Pages
compresses the JSON, so a raw byte count overstates what a reader pays several
times over — `snowpack.json` is 3,607 KB on disk and 322 KB on the wire. The
size guards measure the same way: the reference export's budget, in
`tests/test_refresh.py` and `src/data/boundaries.test.ts` alike, is 64 KB
gzipped, and was a raw byte count until R3 — which would have failed on 142
reservoirs of reviewed capacity while the figure a reader pays was still
inside it. A budget in the wrong unit fails on the wrong thing.

Runtime fetches use `cache: "no-cache"`, which is not "do not cache": it means
never use a stored copy without asking, so the morning's rewrite can never be
served stale and an unchanged file costs a 304 instead of the whole payload.

**The snow series publishes the water-year calendar once** and each site
indexes into it; `validateSnowpackPayload` rebuilds the rows so nothing
downstream knows. Never encode a missing day as a null value — a null reading
is a row that exists, and thousands of absent days are not. The grid is 637
sites by 323 published dates, and 1,477 of those cells had no reading on
2026-08-20. The count moves every morning, which is the point: it is never
zero.

`docs/data-transfer.md` holds the measurements and is the file to update when
they change.

## Freshness: late and withdrawn are different faults

**`carry_forward`** keeps publishing a quiet feed's last value, because a point
vanishing with no explanation is worse. True for days, false for months.

Past `WITHDRAW_AFTER_DAYS` (60) a record is **withdrawn** from the payload
entirely (ADR-056), because `statewideRollup` sums `current_storage_af` with no
freshness filter — so a spring figure is not merely shown out of season, it is
added into a total presented as now. A withdrawal is always stated
(`withdrawn`, `withdrawn_count`, `withdraw_after_days`) and **must never carry
a measurement**: the validator rejects a notice holding `current_storage_af`.

Nothing is deleted. The roster is committed and the judgement is remade every
run, so a reservoir returns on its own the morning its source resumes.
**A drainage area may therefore be empty**; `storageAgainstDrought` omits it
rather than drawing it at zero. Tests about *where* a reservoir is must read
the roster, never `reservoirs.json`, or a quiet feed silently retires an
assertion.

**Being listed is not reporting, and neither is having reported.** The audit's
dormant check asks whether a station has ever answered; the candidate screen
asks whether it has answered **within the year**. This is deliberately not
`WITHDRAW_AFTER_DAYS`: 60 days is about a published reservoir going quiet, a
year is about never admitting one that already has.


**A reviewed hold is a third fault** (ADR-113, ADR-115). The feed is healthy
and a person has taken the reservoir off the roster because no figure it can
be divided by survives review. The admission file states it in
`publication_holds` -- name, reason, HTTPS source and review date, and the
loader refuses a fifth field or a hold naming a station still published -- and
`reviewed_hold_notices` publishes them as `reviewed_holds`, beside the
withdrawals and never among them. `--rebuild-notices` rewrites that array
without touching a reading, and refuses to run while a held reservoir is still
in the payload. Nothing here reverses on its own: a hold ends with a roster
edit, not with a morning's data.

## Drought coverage

Coverage is computed per level into `data/drought/usdm-huc{level}.json` from
the committed polygons, the committed scope boundaries and the committed land
mask. It is deterministic and carries no timestamps, so an unchanged week
writes an unchanged file.

**Every coverage file must describe one week.** `tools/check_drought_pair.py`
globs them all, because a reader who changes the level fetches a different
file. **The archive is one level** — `merge_history` refuses a payload at
another rather than joining two series on one set of codes.

**A week-over-week change needs two files and uses one.** The current coverage
file carries the week before it, about a kilobyte, and that is all a change
needs. Never fetch `usdm-huc6-history.json` to compute one subtraction.
`previous` is always strictly older than `map_date`; the validator refuses a
file comparing a week with itself.

**Not measured is not no drought** (ADR-059). Cells outside
`data/us-land.geojson` are dropped before any class is counted. Class shares
divide by the **measured** land; `measured.percent_of_area` divides by the
whole area and lives in its own block so nothing can sum the two (ADR-046). An
area with no measured land publishes no share at all, not zeros. **A missing
mask stops the run** — without one the engine reports every border basin's far
half as drought-free and looks like a clean run.

## Versioning

**A method version is not a schema version.** A field can keep its name, type
and units while the estimator under it changes, and `schema_version` cannot see
that. `METHOD_VERSION` can. See
[`hydrology-methods.md`](hydrology-methods.md#method-version) for the three
places that refuse to mix, and the one exception.

## Long-lived reference data

**Long-lived reference data carries the date it was checked.**
`tools/check_reference_freshness.py` reads each committed reference file's own
date field against a review interval and reports what is due. It is a tool and
**must never become a test**: a test that fails when a date passes turns the
build red on a morning when no code changed, and a red build freezes the
published numbers. What *is* tested is that every file carries a date and a
policy at all. The generators stamp `retrieved` themselves.

## CI signals

`emit_ci_signals` writes the counts and tables the refresh workflow turns into
self-healing issues — late feeds, withdrawn feeds. The issue bodies are built
by `tools/feed_issue_report.py`, which is deterministic and tested; the
workflow only calls `gh`. See
[`docs/operations/data-refresh.md`](../operations/data-refresh.md).
