# Current architecture

What is true of the repository **now**. Four documents, each owning one
subsystem, each short enough to read before starting work in it.

| Document | Owns |
|---|---|
| [`frontend.md`](frontend.md) | The typed ArcGIS/Calcite application: pages, layers, symbology, layout, readiness, retired routes. |
| [`pipeline.md`](pipeline.md) | The Python data pipelines: modules, generated files, payload cost, freshness, drought coverage. |
| [`hydrology-methods.md`](hydrology-methods.md) | The scientific method behind every published number, and what may not be done to it. |
| [`scopes.md`](scopes.md) | The four different geographic scopes, hydrologic levels, URL state and remembered place. |

## Where authority lives

Agents and humans both need one answer to "which file is current?". This is
it:

| Question | Authority |
|---|---|
| How does the system work today? | `docs/architecture/` |
| Why was it decided that way, and what superseded it? | [`docs/decisions/`](../decisions/README.md) |
| How do I run a recurring procedure? | [`docs/operations/`](../operations/) |
| What happened during the modernization? | [`docs/history/`](../history/README.md) |
| What must every agent obey on every task? | [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) |
| What must an agent obey in *this* directory? | the nearest `AGENTS.md`, and `.claude/rules/` |
| What is the procedure for this recurring task? | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| What is actually enforced? | the tests, validators, types and scripts named below |

**Executable truth outranks prose.** Where a rule below is enforced, the
enforcing check is named beside it. If prose and a passing test disagree, the
test is right and the prose is a bug.

## Product shape

One typed ArcGIS 5.1 + Calcite 5 application with four analytical surfaces,
three documentation pages, three compatibility redirects, one frozen source
oracle, and two Python pipelines.

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `index.html`, `modern.html`, `src/main.ts` | Primary reservoir storage map, and its stable alias. |
| `overview.html`, `src/overview*` | ArcGIS Charts storage workspace. |
| `snow.html`, `src/snow*` | Snow curves, drainage-area map, site map, detail views. |
| `drought.html`, `src/drought*` | Weekly drought map and comparison charts. |
| `methods.html`, `data.html`, `terms.html` | Methods, public data API, terms. |
| `legacy/`, `maplibre/`, `explore.html` | Compatibility redirects only (ADR-031). |
| `public/retired-route.js` | Allowlisted URL-state translation for those redirects. |
| `shared/reservoir-viz.js` | Frozen source-only colour-table owner and test oracle. Never published. |
| `src/` | Strict TypeScript, including the complete runtime data validator. |
| `pipeline/`, `refresh_reservoirs.py`, `refresh_snowpack.py` | Reservoir and snow refresh pipelines. |
| `huc.py`, `watershed_scopes.py`, `admission.py` | Drainage assignment, named scopes, candidate admission. |
| `tools/` | Audits, boundary work, drought computation, measurement. |

## Releases and version numbers

**Three version numbers move for three different reasons, and none of them
follows another.**

| Number | Names | Moves when |
|---|---|---|
| `version` in `package.json` | The application and its published contracts: the pages, the URL state a saved link carries, the shape of the payloads under `/api/`. | A published page or a payload contract changes. Semantic Versioning. |
| `schema_version` in each payload | The structure of that one file. | A field is added, removed or retyped in it. |
| `METHOD_VERSION` | The seasonal estimator behind the derived figures. | The arithmetic changes while the fields do not ([`hydrology-methods.md`](hydrology-methods.md#method-version)). |

The daily numbers move without any of them, which is ADR-002: the morning's
data commit is the deploy.

**A release is a person's assertion, so a person makes it.** The accumulated
`[Unreleased]` section of [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md) is dated and
renamed to the version, an empty `[Unreleased]` heading is left above it,
`package.json` and the lockfile are bumped together, and the tag is cut by
hand. No job tags a release: the one release gate nothing can automate is the
human visual review, because the ArcGIS canvas is blank in headless Chromium.
The version heading carries the date the tag is cut: whoever cuts it sets
that date in the changelog first, then tags that commit.

**Release order confirmed by the owner on 2026-09-18:** release 1.0.0 first.
The existing Topaz Lake PR [#56](https://github.com/buschbrian/western-water-dashboard/pull/56)
and terminal-lake PRs [#61](https://github.com/buschbrian/western-water-dashboard/pull/61)
and [#62](https://github.com/buschbrian/western-water-dashboard/pull/62)
follow afterward; they are not prerequisites for 1.0.0. Keep them out of the
release commit and tag. Their review, conflict resolution, dependency order
(#61 before #62), and version/changelog updates belong to the next release.
This sequencing decision does not record completion of the human visual review.

The scope closed at 1.0.0
([ADR-117](../decisions/ADR-117-close-the-scope-at-version-1-0-0.md)). Work
after it is maintenance and context — words, photographs, a provider that
breaks, a reviewed source question. A new measured domain, a new rollup axis or
a new computing page is out of scope and needs its own record first.

## Generated and source-owned files

Never hand-edit a generated file: the next pipeline run overwrites it, and an
edit that survives review is an unreproducible number on a public page.

| File | Owner | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `reservoirs.json` | generated daily | `refresh_reservoirs.py` |
| `snowpack.json`, `snow_sites.json` | generated daily | `refresh_snowpack.py` |
| `data/drought/usdm-current.geojson` | generated weekly | `tools/fetch_drought_monitor.py` |
| `data/drought/usdm-huc{4,6}.json` | generated daily | `tools/compute_drought_coverage.py` |
| `data/drought/usdm-huc6-history.json` | generated archive | `tools/compute_drought_coverage.py` |
| `reference.json` | long-lived derived | `tools/build_reference_export.py` (`--check` guards drift) |
| `normals.json` | long-lived derived | `tools/build_normal_baselines.py`, on demand only |
| `counties.json` | long-lived derived | `tools/build_county_assignments.py` |
| `capacities.json` | long-lived derived | `tools/build_capacity_table.py` |
| `data/watersheds/*.geojson`, `data/us-land.geojson` | long-lived derived | `tools/fetch_watershed_scope.py`, `tools/fetch_us_land_mask.py` |
| `admitted_*.json` | **hand-maintained, reviewed** | a person, with evidence |
| `huc6.geojson`, `utah-boundary.geojson` | frozen historical | nothing; kept for parity |

`data/generated-files.json` is the machine-readable copy of this table, and
`tests/test_generated_files.py` holds it to the repository.
