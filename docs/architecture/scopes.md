# Scopes, levels and URL state

Four different geographic questions wear the word "scope". Answering two of
them with one constant is the mistake this document exists to prevent.

| Concept | Name in code | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| Drawn scope | `watershed_scopes.DEFAULT_SCOPE`, published as `default_scope` | Which drainage areas do the maps draw? |
| Roster scope | `watershed_scopes.ROSTER_SCOPE`, published as `roster_scope` | Which geography were the published reservoirs admitted from? |
| Opening scope | `OPENING_SCOPE_HUC6_BOUNDS` in `src/viz/extent.ts`, `src/data/opening-scope.ts` | Where does a page open when the reader has chosen nothing? |
| Selected scope | `?state=`, `?area=`, `?level=`, the stored place | Where has *this* reader asked to be? |

## Drawn and roster are two names (ADR-063)

`DEFAULT_SCOPE` is what the maps draw — `west-huc6`, 75 basins across regions
14 to 18. `ROSTER_SCOPE` is the geography the published reservoirs were
admitted from. **The two now name the same scope**: the roster went west and
`ROSTER_SCOPE = DEFAULT_SCOPE`. They stay two names because they answer two
questions, and the next roster move must be able to happen without dragging the
drawn coverage with it. Both are published in `reference.json`; no test, tool or
fixture may name a boundary file directly, because which file holds which
geography has moved twice already.

**23 of the 75 drawn areas hold no reservoir**, which ADR-056 already allowed
for. **Each map draws what it can say something about**: the drought engine
measures all 75 so the drought map draws 75; the snow network reports in 51, so
`measuredScope` narrows the snow map to 51; the storage map draws all 75 as
context around its subject. The two committed boundary files must agree area for
area — fetched at different generalizations they did not, and two drought
figures moved by a rounding step with no weather behind them.

## Where the map opens is a third question, and it is pinned

`HUC6_BOUNDS` in `src/viz/extent.ts` is the roster scope's box and moved west
with it — 19 degrees of longitude. `MAP_BOUNDS` is **not** built from it: it is
built from `OPENING_SCOPE_HUC6_BOUNDS`, a private literal frozen at the box of
the fourteen areas the original roster was admitted from, which is what keeps a
reader who has chosen nothing from opening on the whole west with the
reservoirs too small to point at. That literal equals the frozen oracle's own
`HUC6_BOUNDS` and is ADR-044's contract with the retired routes' saved links;
`extent.test.ts` holds it there. The load the wider box would otherwise put on
the opening view is carried by `src/data/opening-scope.ts` and the first-visit
chooser instead — `unionOfAreaBoxes` over whatever place a reader picked.

## Three levels are offered and the reader picks (ADR-064, ADR-073)

HUC-6 is the default; HUC-4 and HUC-2 are the others. Every figure is published
at all three, which is what makes a reader-chosen level a scope change rather
than the view-scale change ADR-050 refuses. Drought coverage is computed per
level; storage regroups on `huc6[:level]`, exact because codes nest; snow
regroups from *sites* with the pipeline's rule, never by averaging the
published basin means.

**A name is a figure too.** Each coarser level needs a roster published beside
the numbers, or a picker labels its areas by code — the snow region picker read
"14 (137 sites)" for exactly as long as `regions` was missing from the payload
while `subregions` was there. `huc.coarser_roster` builds one per level and
both refresh scripts publish both tables.

**Level 2 draws from the USGS service, levels 4, 6 and 8 from the Living
Atlas** (ADR-073, ADR-034). Same dataset, two publishers, and
`src/arcgis/watershed-layers.ts` says which is which and why. `connect-src`
names `hydro.nationalmap.gov` for the first of them.

**`?level=` is one parameter across all three maps**, like `?area=`, and it
carries the digit count rather than a word because that is what every payload
states and `data.html` documents. Absent means basins; a link never carries
`level=6`. Changing it is a **navigation**, not a re-render: the level changes
which files a page fetches and every figure computed from them, so the control
takes the path a shared link already takes — `location.replace`, never push.
The control is appended when `reference.json` resolves rather than written into
a template, because which levels are on offer is the export's answer
(`drawn_scopes`), and it is built at the Calcite scale of the controls beside it.

**The maps draw the level the payload declares** (ADR-050). No client file
names a hydrologic level; it arrives as `DrainageScope { level, areas }` and the
code is read from the attribute that level names. `JOINABLE_LEVEL` in
`src/data/boundaries.ts` is the set of levels every figure on the site is keyed
at, and
a scope published at another size says so out loud rather than drawing areas
whose hover cards come back empty. Level is deliberately *not* driven by view
scale: a finer outline a reader can point at, with no figure behind it, is less
information rather than more.

**A watershed scope carries its own level.** `watershed_scopes.py` is the one
place that decides which drainage areas exist and how big they are; the level
picks the WBD service layer and the attribute the code arrives in. Codes are
fixed-width, so the level *is* the digit count — `HUC_CODE` in `src/data/huc.ts`
is the shared pattern and accepts any even length to twelve. Never write
`/^\d{6}$/` again. Levels finer than HUC-8 are refused on purpose: the drought
engine's sampled share carries about 0.21 points of error at HUC-10 against a
published precision of 0.1.

**A scope can be registered before it is published.** `published=False` means
the geography exists to be fetched and reviewed and nothing draws it yet; the
reference export skips those and still fails loudly for anything missing that
*is* published.

## A link is never interrupted, and a preference never leaks into one

Three answers can name the place a page opens on and the order is fixed: the
address bar, then the stored choice, then everywhere. `resolveOpeningPlace`
reports which answered, and `shouldAskWhere` reads that rather than re-deriving
it.

The first-visit chooser appears **only** when the query string is empty —
emptiness, not a list of place parameters, because `?reservoir=Flaming+Gorge`
names no place and is unmistakably someone showing someone else a thing. A list
would need updating for every parameter any surface ever adds, and forgetting
one buries a reader's link under a modal, which is what happened and what the
smoke suite's deep-link case now catches. A reader who wants the question back
asks for it: a "Choose another place" control beside the where filters reopens
the same dialog, which changes nothing in the address bar until its own buttons
are pressed.

The stored choice is **never written back into the address bar**: what a reader
copies must be what they see, not what they prefer. `?state=all` exists so that
"everywhere" can be said out loud rather than by silence — deleting the
parameter would produce a link that defers to the *recipient's* stored place. A
stored place that no longer holds anything is cleared rather than left to open
on a blank page tomorrow (`forgetPlaceIfEmpty`); what "empty" means is each
surface's own measurement.

## Two reservoirs are controls, not filters (ADR-011, ADR-062)

Lake Powell and Lake Mead each dominate any total they enter, so each has its
own include/exclude choice and every surface states which way both are set.

**In the reader's view they start included**: a map whose subject is western
water opened with 51 million acre-feet taken out of it, behind two switches most
readers never found. `DEFAULT_URL_STATE` and `DEFAULT_OVERVIEW_STATE` both say
`include`, absence in a link means `include`, and the narrow answer is what a
link spells — `?powell=exclude`, `?mead=exclude`.

**The library default is the opposite, and deliberately so.**
`reservoirInScope` reads `options[key] !== "include"`, so a caller that passes
no `lakeMead` excludes it. That is the ADR-062 guard: a caller written before
Mead joined the roster must not silently start adding 28 million acre-feet
because a page-level default moved. Do not collapse the two defaults into one.

**Rows that are already scoped say so in the type.** `scopeReservoirs` returns
a branded `ScopedReservoirs`, and `rollupOfScoped` is the only way to total a
set that has already been narrowed — it takes no scope dimensions at all, so it
cannot narrow twice. `WIDEST_SCOPE` remains for callers that must still pass an
options object, and its `Required` is what makes admitting the next dominant
reservoir a compile error rather than a silent exclusion.

## Two place menus to a page (ADR-084)

Every map page asks "where am I" with two single-select menus, both built as
indented option groups ([ADR-076](../decisions/ADR-076-nest-the-place-menus-and-let-the-heading-carry-the-state.md)'s
shape):

| Menu | Offers | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| **Where** (`createWhereMenu`) | states; counties grouped beneath their state where the surface has FIPS county material (the storage charts) | a state row → `?state=`, a county row → `?county=` |
| **Drainage area** (`createDrainageMenu`) | regions, subregions and basins in one menu, each tier grouped under its parent | `?area=` (or `?drainage=` on storage), plus `?level=` when the row forces it |

Region, subregion and basin are one axis at three resolutions, so they live in
one menu rather than three selects. **A row finer than the drawn level
navigates** — it takes `location.replace` carrying its own `?level=`, because
the level decides which files the page fetches (ADR-064); a row coarser than or
equal to it narrows by prefix exactly as a link does. The level control stays:
it answers the drawn question (division without narrowing) and the menu answers
the selected question; merging them would answer two of the four scopes with
one control.

Snow's rows are gated by what its payload can draw: a row at the drawn tier is
offered only when it has a publishable figure, a coarser row only when some
publishable choice sits beneath it, and nothing finer than the drawn tier is
offered. That is ADR-071's empty-page repair carried forward per row.
Drought and storage offer the full published roster. On storage every drainage
pick is the in-page dimming filter at any width (codes nest, so a subregion row
prefix-filters), written to `?drainage=` through the same `writeUrl` as every
other filter there; reading `?area=` links still works.

The pure half lives in `where-control-model.ts` (`whereMenuView`,
`drainageMenuView`, `nextSelectionForState`, `nextSelectionForDrainageRow`)
over `resolveOpeningScope`'s narrowing; the DOM half is `where-control.ts`.
The menus narrow against state but never against the reader's own area pick —
a menu that removed the families around the current choice would leave "All"
as the only way out.

County exists only where the payload carries FIPS codes: reservoirs do, snow's
site counties are bare names (recorded as debt in ADR-084), drought publishes
no county rows. A county pick writes `?county=` and leaves `?state=` alone;
the two axes stay two even though the controls are one.

## A county is where a thing is; a drainage area is where its water goes

(ADR-058, ADR-060.) Counties are a *search and filter* axis and never a
grouping one — 375 reservoirs fall in 157 counties and 73 hold exactly one, so
a county total is a reservoir total wearing a county's name. Nearly half the
counties on the roster hold a single reservoir, and the ratio that made the
aggregation framing wrong at 68 reservoirs held as the roster went west: the
same 375 sit in 52 drainage areas, about seven to an area, with only nine
areas holding exactly one.

The dam-versus-waterbody question `OPEN-BACKLOG-SCOPING.md` left open was
measured 2026-08-21 (`tools/probe_county_dam_point.py`): of the 30 published
reservoirs with a reviewed dam point, **2** would move county if counties
followed the drainage rule — Lake Powell (San Juan County, Utah → Coconino
County, Arizona) and Lost Lake (Wasatch County → Summit County, Utah). Both
are already the named examples behind the rule; no third case emerged from
the larger roster, and the waterbody assignment point stands.

The key is the five-digit FIPS code and never the name: this roster holds seven
repeated county names — two each of Carbon, Garfield, Lincoln, San Juan and
Summit, and **three** each of Lake, in California, Montana and Oregon, and
Washington, in Idaho, Oregon and Utah. The assignment point is the
**waterbody**, deliberately not the dam the drainage area uses — Glen Canyon Dam
is in Coconino County, Arizona and Lake Powell is in San Juan County, Utah. No
county geometry is ever committed; the service resolves the point and answers
with a code, and the *detailed* Living Atlas layer is required rather than
preferred, because the generalized one puts Lost Lake outside Wasatch County.

## A state is three questions (ADR-060)

`state` is the one state holding the published point, `waterbody_states` every
state the water touches, and `connected_states` every state the drainage area
reaches. Hyrum is wholly in Utah and fed from Idaho. A filter must pick one and
say which; ADR-011's warning is unchanged.

**A state filter means the water.** The control picks `waterbody_states`: it is
what `intersects_utah` has always meant, so Bear Lake stays in Utah's list where
a reader expects it. A payload without the array falls back to the point's own
state rather than vanishing from every state filter, and that default is *not* a
finding — the reviewed table holds three waterbodies and does not claim to be
complete. Re-run the dam-versus-waterbody check when the roster grows; it is
cheap, it is already written, and it is what found Lake Powell.

## The payload carries the roster; the service carries the shapes

(ADR-047, ADR-048.) `reference.json` publishes each area's code, name and states
and no drainage geometry — it was 1,001 KB raw and is 126.6 KB raw, **22.5 KB
on the wire**, and every map page fetches it whole on every load. Quote the wire
figure. Outlines come from the hosted Watershed Boundary Dataset, quantized to
the view.
